Some of the tools and utilities below are Java classes which are passed directly to the *bin/hbase* command, as referred to in the last line of the usage instructions. Others, such as \`hbase shell\` ([The Apache HBase Shell](/docs/shell)), \`hbase upgrade\` ([Upgrading](/docs/upgrading)), and \`hbase thrift\` ([Thrift API and Filter Language](/docs/thrift-filter-language)), are documented elsewhere in this guide.

## Canary

The Canary tool can help users "canary-test" the HBase cluster status. The default "region mode" fetches a row from every column-family of every regions. In "regionserver mode", the Canary tool will fetch a row from a random region on each of the cluster's RegionServers. In "zookeeper mode", the Canary will read the root znode on each member of the zookeeper ensemble.

To see usage, pass the \`-help\` parameter (if you pass no parameters, the Canary tool starts executing in the default region "mode" fetching a row from every region in the cluster).

Here are some examples based on the following given case: given two Table objects called test-01 and test-02 each with two column family cf1 and cf2 respectively, deployed on 3 RegionServers. See the following table.

| RegionServer | test-01 | test-02 |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- |
| rs1          | r1      | r2      |
| rs2          | r2      |         |
| rs3          | r2      | r1      |

Following are some example outputs based on the previous given case.

### Canary test for every column family (store) of every region of every table

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary

3/12/09 03:26:32 INFO tool.Canary: read from region test-01,,1386230156732.0e3c7d77ffb6361ea1b996ac1042ca9a. column family cf1 in 2ms

\`\`\`

So you can see, table test-01 has two regions and two column families, so the Canary tool in the default "region mode" will pick 4 small piece of data from 4 (2 region \\* 2 store) different stores. This is a default behavior.

### Canary test for every column family (store) of every region of a specific table(s)

You can also test one or more specific tables by passing table names.

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary test-01 test-02

\`\`\`

### Canary test with RegionServer granularity

In "regionserver mode", the Canary tool will pick one small piece of data from each RegionServer (You can also pass one or more RegionServer names as arguments to the canary-test when in "regionserver mode").

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary -regionserver

13/12/09 06:05:17 INFO tool.Canary: Read from table:test-01 on region server:rs2 in 72ms
13/12/09 06:05:17 INFO tool.Canary: Read from table:test-02 on region server:rs3 in 34ms
13/12/09 06:05:17 INFO tool.Canary: Read from table:test-01 on region server:rs1 in 56ms

\`\`\`

### Canary test with regular expression pattern

You can pass regexes for table names when in "region mode" or for servernames when in "regionserver mode". The below will test both table test-01 and test-02.

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary -e test-0[1-2]

\`\`\`

### Run canary test as a "daemon"

Run repeatedly with an interval defined via the option \`-interval\` (default value is 60 seconds). This daemon will stop itself and return non-zero error code if any error occur. To have the daemon keep running across errors, pass the -f flag with its value set to false (see usage above).

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary -daemon

\`\`\`

To run repeatedly with 5 second intervals and not stop on errors, do the following.

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary -daemon -interval 5 -f false

\`\`\`

### Force timeout if canary test stuck

In some cases the request is stuck and no response is sent back to the client. This can happen with dead RegionServers which the master has not yet noticed. Because of this we provide a timeout option to kill the canary test and return a non-zero error code. The below sets the timeout value to 60 seconds (the default value is 600 seconds).

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary -t 60000

\`\`\`

### Enable write sniffing in canary

By default, the canary tool only checks read operations. To enable the write sniffing, you can run the canary with the \`-writeSniffing\` option set. When write sniffing is enabled, the canary tool will create an hbase table and make sure the regions of the table are distributed to all region servers. In each sniffing period, the canary will try to put data to these regions to check the write availability of each region server.

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary -writeSniffing

\`\`\`

The default write table is \`hbase:canary\` and can be specified with the option \`-writeTable\`.

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary -writeSniffing -writeTable ns:canary

\`\`\`

The default value size of each put is 10 bytes. You can set it via the config key: \`hbase.canary.write.value.size\`.

### Treat read / write failure as error

By default, the canary tool only logs read failures — due to e.g. RetriesExhaustedException, etc. — and will return the 'normal' exit code. To treat read/write failure as errors, you can run canary with the \`-treatFailureAsError\` option. When enabled, read/write failures will result in an error exit code.

\`\`\`bash
$ \${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase canary -treatFailureAsError

\`\`\`

### Running Canary in a Kerberos-enabled Cluster

To run the Canary in a Kerberos-enabled cluster, configure the following two properties in *hbase-site.xml*:

* \`hbase.client.keytab.file\`
* \`hbase.client.kerberos.principal\`

Kerberos credentials are refreshed every 30 seconds when Canary runs in daemon mode.

To configure the DNS interface for the client, configure the following optional properties in *hbase-site.xml*.

* \`hbase.client.dns.interface\`
* \`hbase.client.dns.nameserver\`

**Example Canary in a Kerberos-Enabled Cluster**\\
This example shows each of the properties with valid values.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.client.kerberos.principal</name>
  <value>hbase/_HOST@YOUR-REALM.COM</value>
</property>
<property>

## Health Checker

You can configure HBase to run a script periodically and if it fails N times (configurable), have the server exit. See *HBASE-7351 Periodic health check script* for configurations and detail.

## Driver

Several frequently-accessed utilities are provided as \`Driver\` classes, and executed by the *bin/hbase* command. These utilities represent MapReduce jobs which run on your cluster. They are run in the following way, replacing *UtilityName* with the utility you want to run. This command assumes you have set the environment variable \`HBASE_HOME\` to the directory where HBase is unpacked on your server.

\`\`\`bash
\${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.UtilityName
\`\`\`

The following utilities are available:

\`LoadIncrementalHFiles\`\\
Complete a bulk data load.

\`CopyTable\`\\
Export a table from the local cluster to a peer cluster.

\`Export\`\\
Write table data to HDFS.

\`Import\`\\
Import data written by a previous \`Export\` operation.

\`ImportTsv\`\\
Import data in TSV format.

\`RowCounter\`\\
Count rows in an HBase table.

\`CellCounter\`\\
Count cells in an HBase table.

\`replication.VerifyReplication\`\\
Compare the data from tables in two different clusters. WARNING: It doesn't work for incrementColumnValues'd cells since the timestamp is changed. Note that this command is in a different package than the others.

Each command except \`RowCounter\` and \`CellCounter\` accept a single \`--help\` argument to print usage instructions.

## HBase \`hbck\`

The \`hbck\` tool that shipped with hbase-1.x has been made read-only in hbase-2.x. It is not able to repair hbase-2.x clusters as hbase internals have changed. Nor should its assessments in read-only mode be trusted as it does not understand hbase-2.x operation.

A new tool, [HBase \`HBCK2\`](/docs/operational-management/tools#hbase-hbck2), described in the next section, replaces \`hbck\`.

## HBase \`HBCK2\`

\`HBCK2\` is the successor to [HBase \`HBCK\`](/docs/operational-management/tools#hbase-hbck), the hbase-1.x fix tool (A.K.A \`hbck1\`). Use it in place of \`hbck1\` making repairs against hbase-2.x installs.

\`HBCK2\` does not ship as part of hbase. It can be found as a subproject of the companion [hbase-operator-tools](https://github.com/apache/hbase-operator-tools) repository at [Apache HBase HBCK2 Tool](https://github.com/apache/hbase-operator-tools/tree/master/hbase-hbck2). \`HBCK2\` was moved out of hbase so it could evolve at a cadence apart from that of hbase core.

See the [HBCK2](https://github.com/apache/hbase-operator-tools/tree/master/hbase-hbck2) Home Page for how \`HBCK2\` differs from \`hbck1\`, and for how to build and use it.

Once built, you can run \`HBCK2\` as follows:

\`\`\`bash
$ hbase hbck -j /path/to/HBCK2.jar

\`\`\`

This will generate \`HBCK2\` usage describing commands and options.

## HFile Tool

See [HFile Tool](/docs/architecture/regions##architecture-regions-store-hfile-tool).

## WAL Tools

For bulk replaying WAL files or *recovered.edits* files, see [WALPlayer](/docs/operational-management/tools#walplayer). For reading/verifying individual files, read on.

### WALPrettyPrinter

The \`WALPrettyPrinter\` is a tool with configurable options to print the contents of a WAL or a *recovered.edits* file. You can invoke it via the HBase cli with the 'wal' command.

\`\`\`bash
 $ ./bin/hbase wal hdfs://example.org:9000/hbase/WALs/example.org,60020,1283516293161/10.10.21.10%3A60020.1283973724012
\`\`\`

<Callout type="info" title="WAL Printing in older versions of HBase">
  Prior to version 2.0, the \`WALPrettyPrinter\` was called the \`HLogPrettyPrinter\`, after an internal name for HBase's write ahead log. In those versions, you can print the contents of a WAL using the same configuration as above, but with the 'hlog' command.

  \`\`\`bash
   $ ./bin/hbase hlog hdfs://example.org:9000/hbase/.logs/example.org,60020,1283516293161/10.10.21.10%3A60020.1283973724012

</Callout>

## Compression Tool

See [compression.test](/docs/compression#compressiontest).

## CopyTable

CopyTable is a utility that can copy part or of all of a table, either to the same cluster or another cluster. The target table must first exist. The usage is as follows:

\`\`\`bash
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.CopyTable --help
/bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.CopyTable --help
Usage: CopyTable [general options] [--starttime=X] [--endtime=Y] [--new.name=NEW] [--peer.adr=ADR] <tablename>

Options:
 rs.class     hbase.regionserver.class of the peer cluster,
              specify if different from current cluster
 rs.impl      hbase.regionserver.impl of the peer cluster,
 startrow     the start row
 stoprow      the stop row
 starttime    beginning of the time range (unixtime in millis)
              without endtime means from starttime to forever
 endtime      end of the time range.  Ignored if no starttime specified.
 versions     number of cell versions to copy
 new.name     new table's name
 peer.uri     The URI of the peer cluster
 peer.adr     Address of the peer cluster given in the format
              hbase.zookeeer.quorum:hbase.zookeeper.client.port:zookeeper.znode.parent
              Do not take effect if peer.uri is specified
              Deprecated, please use peer.uri instead
 families     comma-separated list of families to copy
              To copy from cf1 to cf2, give sourceCfName:destCfName.
              To keep the same name, just give "cfName"
 all.cells    also copy delete markers and deleted cells

Args:
 tablename    Name of the table to copy

Examples:
 To copy 'TestTable' to a cluster that uses replication for a 1 hour window:
 $ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.CopyTable --starttime=1265875194289 --endtime=1265878794289 --peer.adr=server1,server2,server3:2181:/hbase --families=myOldCf:myNewCf,cf2,cf3 TestTable

For performance consider the following general options:
  It is recommended that you set the following to >=100. A higher value uses more memory but
  decreases the round trip time to the server and may increase performance.
    -Dhbase.client.scanner.caching=100
  The following should always be set to false, to prevent writing data twice, which may produce
  inaccurate results.
    -Dmapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution=false
\`\`\`

Starting from 3.0.0, we introduce a \`peer.uri\` option so the \`peer.adr\` option is deprecated. Please use connection URI for specifying HBase clusters. For all previous versions, you should still use the \`peer.adr\` option.

<Callout type="info" title="Scanner Caching">
  Caching for the input Scan is configured via \`hbase.client.scanner.caching\` in the job
  configuration.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Versions">

## HashTable/SyncTable

HashTable/SyncTable is a two steps tool for synchronizing table data, where each of the steps are implemented as MapReduce jobs. Similarly to CopyTable, it can be used for partial or entire table data syncing, under same or remote cluster. However, it performs the sync in a more efficient way than CopyTable. Instead of copying all cells in specified row key/time period range, HashTable (the first step) creates hashed indexes for batch of cells on source table and output those as results. On the next stage, SyncTable scans the source table and now calculates hash indexes for table cells, compares these hashes with the outputs of HashTable, then it just scans (and compares) cells for diverging hashes, only updating mismatching cells. This results in less network traffic/data transfers, which can be impacting when syncing large tables on remote clusters.

### Step 1, HashTable

First, run HashTable on the source table cluster (this is the table whose state will be copied to its counterpart).

Usage:

\`\`\`bash
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.HashTable --help
Usage: HashTable [options] <tablename> <outputpath>

Options:
 batchsize         the target amount of bytes to hash in each batch
                   rows are added to the batch until this size is reached
                   (defaults to 8000 bytes)
 numhashfiles      the number of hash files to create
                   if set to fewer than number of regions then
                   the job will create this number of reducers
                   (defaults to 1/100 of regions — at least 1)
 startrow          the start row
 stoprow           the stop row
 starttime         beginning of the time range (unixtime in millis)
                   without endtime means from starttime to forever
 endtime           end of the time range.  Ignored if no starttime specified.
 scanbatch         scanner batch size to support intra row scans
 versions          number of cell versions to include
 families          comma-separated list of families to include
 ignoreTimestamps  if true, ignores cell timestamps

Args:
 tablename     Name of the table to hash
 outputpath    Filesystem path to put the output data

Examples:
 To hash 'TestTable' in 32kB batches for a 1 hour window into 50 files:
 $ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.HashTable --batchsize=32000 --numhashfiles=50 --starttime=1265875194289 --endtime=1265878794289 --families=cf2,cf3 TestTable /hashes/testTable
\`\`\`

The **batchsize** property defines how much cell data for a given region will be hashed together in a single hash value. Sizing this properly has a direct impact on the sync efficiency, as it may lead to less scans executed by mapper tasks of SyncTable (the next step in the process). The rule of thumb is that, the smaller the number of cells out of sync (lower probability of finding a diff), larger batch size values can be determined.

### Step 2, SyncTable

Once HashTable has completed on source cluster, SyncTable can be ran on target cluster. Just like replication and other synchronization jobs, it requires that all RegionServers/DataNodes on source cluster be accessible by NodeManagers on the target cluster (where SyncTable job tasks will be running).

Usage:

\`\`\`bash
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.SyncTable --help
Usage: SyncTable [options] <sourcehashdir> <sourcetable> <targettable>

Options:
 sourceuri        Cluster connection uri of the source table
                  (defaults to cluster in classpath's config)
 sourcezkcluster  ZK cluster key of the source table
                  (defaults to cluster in classpath's config)
                  Do not take effect if sourceuri is specifie
                  Deprecated, please use sourceuri instead
 targeturi        Cluster connection uri of the target table
                  (defaults to cluster in classpath's config)
 targetzkcluster  ZK cluster key of the target table
                  (defaults to cluster in classpath's config)
                  Do not take effect if targeturi is specified
                  Deprecated, please use targeturi instead
 dryrun           if true, output counters but no writes
                  (defaults to false)
 doDeletes        if false, does not perform deletes
                  (defaults to true)
 doPuts           if false, does not perform puts
                  (defaults to true)
 ignoreTimestamps if true, ignores cells timestamps while comparing
                  cell values. Any missing cell on target then gets
                  added with current time as timestamp
                  (defaults to false)

Args:
 sourcehashdir    path to HashTable output dir for source table
                  (see org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.HashTable)
 sourcetable      Name of the source table to sync from
 targettable      Name of the target table to sync to

Examples:
 For a dry run SyncTable of tableA from a remote source cluster
 to a local target cluster:
 $ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.SyncTable --dryrun=true --sourcezkcluster=zk1.example.com,zk2.example.com,zk3.example.com:2181:/hbase hdfs://nn:9000/hashes/tableA tableA tableA
\`\`\`

Starting from 3.0.0, we introduce \`sourceuri\` and \`targeturi\` options so \`sourcezkcluster\` and \`targetzkcluster\` are deprecated. Please use connection URI for specifying HBase clusters. For all previous versions, you should still use \`sourcezkcluster\` and \`targetzkcluster\`.

Cell comparison takes ROW/FAMILY/QUALIFIER/TIMESTAMP/VALUE into account for equality. When syncing at the target, missing cells will be added with original timestamp value from source. That may cause unexpected results after SyncTable completes, for example, if missing cells on target have a delete marker with a timestamp T2 (say, a bulk delete performed by mistake), but source cells timestamps have an older value T1, then those cells would still be unavailable at target because of the newer delete marker timestamp. Since cell timestamps might not be relevant to all use cases, *ignoreTimestamps* option adds the flexibility to avoid using cells timestamp in the comparison. When using *ignoreTimestamps* set to true, this option must be specified for both HashTable and SyncTable steps.

The **dryrun** option is useful when a read only, diff report is wanted, as it will produce only COUNTERS indicating the differences, but will not perform any actual changes. It can be used as an alternative to VerifyReplication tool.

By default, SyncTable will cause target table to become an exact copy of source table (at least, for the specified startrow/stoprow or/and starttime/endtime).

Setting doDeletes to false modifies default behaviour to not delete target cells that are missing on source. Similarly, setting doPuts to false modifies default behaviour to not add missing cells on target. Setting both doDeletes and doPuts to false would give same effect as setting dryrun to true.

## Export

Export is a utility that will dump the contents of table to HDFS in a sequence file. The Export can be run via a Coprocessor Endpoint or MapReduce. Invoke via:

**mapreduce-based Export**

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.Export TABLENAME OUTPUTDIR [VERSIONS [STARTTIME [ENDTIME]]]
\`\`\`

**endpoint-based Export**

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure the Export coprocessor is enabled by adding \`org.apache.hadoop.hbase.coprocessor.Export\`
  to \`hbase.coprocessor.region.classes\`.
</Callout>

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.coprocessor.Export TABLENAME OUTPUTDIR [VERSIONS [STARTTIME [ENDTIME]]]
\`\`\`

The outputdir is a HDFS directory that does not exist prior to the export. When done, the exported files will be owned by the user invoking the export command.

**The Comparison of Endpoint-based Export And Mapreduce-based Export**

<Callout type="info">
  To see usage instructions, run the command with no options. Available options include specifying
  column families and applying filters during the export.
</Callout>

By default, the \`Export\` tool only exports the newest version of a given cell, regardless of the number of versions stored. To export more than one version, replace ***\\<versions>*** with the desired number of versions.

For mapreduce based Export, if you want to export cell tags then set the following config property \`hbase.client.rpc.codec\` to \`org.apache.hadoop.hbase.codec.KeyValueCodecWithTags\`

Note: caching for the input Scan is configured via \`hbase.client.scanner.caching\` in the job configuration.

## Import

Import is a utility that will load data that has been exported back into HBase. Invoke via:

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase -Dhbase.import.version=0.94 org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.Import <tablename> <inputdir>
\`\`\`

<Callout type="info">
  To see usage instructions, run the command with no options.
</Callout>

To import 0.94 exported files in a 0.96 cluster or onwards, you need to set system property "hbase.import.version" when running the import command as below:

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase -Dhbase.import.version=0.94 org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.Import TABLENAME INPUTDIR
\`\`\`

If you want to import cell tags then set the following config property \`hbase.client.rpc.codec\` to \`org.apache.hadoop.hbase.codec.KeyValueCodecWithTags\`

## ImportTsv

ImportTsv is a utility that will load data in TSV format into HBase. It has two distinct usages: loading data from TSV format in HDFS into HBase via Puts, and preparing StoreFiles to be loaded via the \`completebulkload\`.

To load data via Puts (i.e., non-bulk loading):

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.ImportTsv -Dimporttsv.columns=a,b,c <tablename> <hdfs-inputdir>
\`\`\`

To generate StoreFiles for bulk-loading:

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.ImportTsv -Dimporttsv.columns=a,b,c -Dimporttsv.bulk.output=hdfs://storefile-outputdir <tablename> <hdfs-data-inputdir>
\`\`\`

These generated StoreFiles can be loaded into HBase via [completebulkload](/docs/operational-management/tools#completebulkload).

### ImportTsv Options

Running \`ImportTsv\` with no arguments prints brief usage information:

\`\`\`text
Usage: importtsv -Dimporttsv.columns=a,b,c TABLENAME INPUTDIR

Imports the given input directory of TSV data into the specified table.

The column names of the TSV data must be specified using the -Dimporttsv.columns
option. This option takes the form of comma-separated column names, where each
column name is either a simple column family, or a columnfamily:qualifier. The special
column name HBASE_ROW_KEY is used to designate that this column should be used
as the row key for each imported record. You must specify exactly one column
to be the row key, and you must specify a column name for every column that exists in the
input data.

By default importtsv will load data directly into HBase. To instead generate
HFiles of data to prepare for a bulk data load, pass the option:
  -Dimporttsv.bulk.output=/path/for/output
  Note: the target table will be created with default column family descriptors if it does not already exist.

Other options that may be specified with -D include:
  -Dimporttsv.skip.bad.lines=false - fail if encountering an invalid line
  '-Dimporttsv.separator=|' - eg separate on pipes instead of tabs
  -Dimporttsv.timestamp=currentTimeAsLong - use the specified timestamp for the import
  -Dimporttsv.mapper.class=my.Mapper - A user-defined Mapper to use instead of org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TsvImporterMapper

\`\`\`

### ImportTsv Example

For example, assume that we are loading data into a table called 'datatsv' with a ColumnFamily called 'd' with two columns "c1" and "c2".

Assume that an input file exists as follows:

\`\`\`text
row1    c1  c2
row2    c1  c2
row3    c1  c2
row4    c1  c2
row5    c1  c2
row6    c1  c2
row7    c1  c2
row8    c1  c2
row9    c1  c2
row10   c1  c2

\`\`\`

For ImportTsv to use this input file, the command line needs to look like this:

\`\`\`bash
 HADOOP_CLASSPATH=\`\${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase classpath\` \${HADOOP_HOME}/bin/hadoop jar \${HBASE_HOME}/hbase-mapreduce-VERSION.jar importtsv -Dimporttsv.columns=HBASE_ROW_KEY,d:c1,d:c2 -Dimporttsv.bulk.output=hdfs://storefileoutput datatsv hdfs://inputfile

\`\`\`

... and in this example the first column is the rowkey, which is why the HBASE\\_ROW\\_KEY is used. The second and third columns in the file will be imported as "d:c1" and "d:c2", respectively.

### ImportTsv Warning

If you have preparing a lot of data for bulk loading, make sure the target HBase table is pre-split appropriately.

### See Also

For more information about bulk-loading HFiles into HBase, see [arch.bulk.load](/docs/architecture/bulk-loading)

## CompleteBulkLoad

The \`completebulkload\` utility will move generated StoreFiles into an HBase table. This utility is often used in conjunction with output from [importtsv](/docs/operational-management/tools#importtsv).

There are two ways to invoke this utility, with explicit classname and via the driver:

**Explicit Classname**

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.tool.LoadIncrementalHFiles hdfs://storefileoutput TABLENAME

\`\`\`

**Driver**

\`\`\`bash
HADOOP_CLASSPATH=\`\${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase classpath\` \${HADOOP_HOME}/bin/hadoop jar \${HBASE_HOME}/hbase-mapreduce-VERSION.jar completebulkload hdfs://storefileoutput TABLENAME

\`\`\`

### CompleteBulkLoad Warning

Data generated via MapReduce is often created with file permissions that are not compatible with the running HBase process. Assuming you're running HDFS with permissions enabled, those permissions will need to be updated before you run CompleteBulkLoad.

For more information about bulk-loading HFiles into HBase, see [arch.bulk.load](/docs/architecture/bulk-loading).

## WALPlayer

WALPlayer is a utility to replay WAL files into HBase.

The WAL can be replayed for a set of tables or all tables, and a timerange can be provided (in milliseconds). The WAL is filtered to this set of tables. The output can optionally be mapped to another set of tables.

WALPlayer can also generate HFiles for later bulk importing, in that case only a single table and no mapping can be specified.

Finally, you can use WALPlayer to replay the content of a Regions \`recovered.edits\` directory (the files under \`recovered.edits\` directory have the same format as WAL files).

<Callout type="info" title="WALPrettyPrinter">
  To read or verify single WAL files or *recovered.edits* files, since they share the WAL format,
  see [WAL Tools](/docs/operational-management/tools#wal-tools).
</Callout>

Invoke via:

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.WALPlayer [options] <WAL inputdir> [<tables> <tableMappings>]>
\`\`\`

For example:

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.WALPlayer /backuplogdir oldTable1,oldTable2 newTable1,newTable2
\`\`\`

WALPlayer, by default, runs as a mapreduce job. To NOT run WALPlayer as a mapreduce job on your cluster, force it to run all in the local process by adding the flags \`-Dmapreduce.jobtracker.address=local\` on the command line.

### WALPlayer Options

Running \`WALPlayer\` with no arguments prints brief usage information:

\`\`\`text
Usage: WALPlayer [options] <WAL inputdir> [<tables> <tableMappings>]
 <WAL inputdir>   directory of WALs to replay.
 <tables>         comma separated list of tables. If no tables specified,
                  all are imported (even hbase:meta if present).
 <tableMappings>  WAL entries can be mapped to a new set of tables by passing
                  <tableMappings>, a comma separated list of target tables.
                  If specified, each table in <tables> must have a mapping.
To generate HFiles to bulk load instead of loading HBase directly, pass:
 -Dwal.bulk.output=/path/for/output
 Only one table can be specified, and no mapping allowed!
To specify a time range, pass:
 -Dwal.start.time=[date|ms]
 -Dwal.end.time=[date|ms]
 The start and the end date of timerange (inclusive). The dates can be
 expressed in milliseconds-since-epoch or yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SS format.
 E.g. 1234567890120 or 2009-02-13T23:32:30.12
Other options:
 -Dmapreduce.job.name=jobName
 Use the specified mapreduce job name for the wal player
 -Dwal.input.separator=' '
 Change WAL filename separator (WAL dir names use default ','.)
For performance also consider the following options:
  -Dmapreduce.map.speculative=false
  -Dmapreduce.reduce.speculative=false
\`\`\`

## RowCounter

[RowCounter](https://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/mapreduce/RowCounter.html) is a mapreduce job to count all the rows of a table. This is a good utility to use as a sanity check to ensure that HBase can read all the blocks of a table if there are any concerns of metadata inconsistency. It will run the mapreduce all in a single process but it will run faster if you have a MapReduce cluster in place for it to exploit. It is possible to limit the time range of data to be scanned by using the \`--starttime=[starttime]\` and \`--endtime=[endtime]\` flags. The scanned data can be limited based on keys using the \`--range=[startKey],[endKey][;[startKey],[endKey]...]\` option.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase rowcounter [options] <tablename> [--starttime=<start> --endtime=<end>] [--range=[startKey],[endKey][;[startKey],[endKey]...]] [<column1> <column2>...]
\`\`\`

RowCounter only counts one version per cell.

For performance consider to use \`-Dhbase.client.scanner.caching=100\` and \`-Dmapreduce.map.speculative=false\` options.

## CellCounter

HBase ships another diagnostic mapreduce job called [CellCounter](https://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/mapreduce/CellCounter.html). Like RowCounter, it gathers more fine-grained statistics about your table. The statistics gathered by CellCounter are more fine-grained and include:

* Total number of rows in the table.
* Total number of CFs across all rows.
* Total qualifiers across all rows.
* Total occurrence of each CF.
* Total occurrence of each qualifier.
* Total number of versions of each qualifier.

The program allows you to limit the scope of the run. Provide a row regex or prefix to limit the rows to analyze. Specify a time range to scan the table by using the \`--starttime=<starttime>\` and \`--endtime=<endtime>\` flags.

Use \`hbase.mapreduce.scan.column.family\` to specify scanning a single column family.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase cellcounter TABLENAME OUTPUT_DIR [reportSeparator] [regex or prefix] [--starttime=STARTTIME --endtime=ENDTIME]
\`\`\`

Note: just like RowCounter, caching for the input Scan is configured via \`hbase.client.scanner.caching\` in the job configuration.

## mlockall

It is possible to optionally pin your servers in physical memory making them less likely to be swapped out in oversubscribed environments by having the servers call [mlockall](http://linux.die.net/man/2/mlockall) on startup. See [HBASE-4391 Add ability to start RS as root and call mlockall](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4391) for how to build the optional library and have it run on startup.

## Offline Compaction Tool

**CompactionTool** provides a way of running compactions (either minor or major) as an independent process from the RegionServer. It reuses same internal implementation classes executed by RegionServer compaction feature. However, since this runs on a complete separate independent java process, it releases RegionServers from the overhead involved in rewrite a set of hfiles, which can be critical for latency sensitive use cases.

Usage:

\`\`\`
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.CompactionTool

Usage: java org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.CompactionTool \\
  [-compactOnce] [-major] [-mapred] [-D<property=value>]* files...

Options:
 mapred         Use MapReduce to run compaction.
 compactOnce    Execute just one compaction step. (default: while needed)
 major          Trigger major compaction.

Note: -D properties will be applied to the conf used.
For example:
 To stop delete of compacted file, pass -Dhbase.compactiontool.delete=false
 To set tmp dir, pass -Dhbase.tmp.dir=ALTERNATE_DIR

Examples:
 To compact the full 'TestTable' using MapReduce:
 $ hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.CompactionTool -mapred hdfs://hbase/data/default/TestTable

 To compact column family 'x' of the table 'TestTable' region 'abc':
 $ hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.CompactionTool hdfs://hbase/data/default/TestTable/abc/x
\`\`\`

As shown by usage options above, **CompactionTool** can run as a standalone client or a mapreduce job. When running as mapreduce job, each family dir is handled as an input split, and is processed by a separate map task.

The **compactionOnce** parameter controls how many compaction cycles will be performed until **CompactionTool** program decides to finish its work. If omitted, it will assume it should keep running compactions on each specified family as determined by the given compaction policy configured. For more info on compaction policy, see [compaction](/docs/architecture/regions#compaction).

If a major compaction is desired, **major** flag can be specified. If omitted, **CompactionTool** will assume minor compaction is wanted by default.

It also allows for configuration overrides with \`-D\` flag. In the usage section above, for example, \`-Dhbase.compactiontool.delete=false\` option will instruct compaction engine to not delete original files from temp folder.

Files targeted for compaction must be specified as parent hdfs dirs. It allows for multiple dirs definition, as long as each for these dirs are either a **family**, a **region**, or a **table** dir. If a table or region dir is passed, the program will recursively iterate through related sub-folders, effectively running compaction for each family found below the table/region level.

Since these dirs are nested under **hbase** hdfs directory tree, **CompactionTool** requires hbase super user permissions in order to have access to required hfiles.

<Callout type="info" title="Running in MapReduce mode">
  MapReduce mode offers the ability to process each family dir in parallel, as a separate map task.
  Generally, it would make sense to run in this mode when specifying one or more table dirs as
  targets for compactions. The caveat, though, is that if number of families to be compacted become
  too large, the related mapreduce job may have indirect impacts on **RegionServers** performance .
  Since **NodeManagers** are normally co-located with RegionServers, such large jobs could compete
  for IO/Bandwidth resources with the **RegionServers**.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="MajorCompaction completely disabled on RegionServers due performance impacts">
  **Major compactions** can be a costly operation (see
  [compaction](/docs/architecture/regions#compaction)), and can indeed impact performance on
  RegionServers, leading operators to completely disable it for critical low latency application.
  **CompactionTool** could be used as an alternative in such scenarios, although, additional custom
  application logic would need to be implemented, such as deciding scheduling and selection of
  tables/regions/families target for a given compaction run.
</Callout>

For additional details about CompactionTool, see also [CompactionTool](https://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/regionserver/CompactionTool.html).

## \`hbase clean\`

The \`hbase clean\` command cleans HBase data from ZooKeeper, HDFS, or both. It is appropriate to use for testing. Run it with no options for usage instructions. The \`hbase clean\` command was introduced in HBase 0.98.

\`\`\`text
$ bin/hbase clean
Usage: hbase clean (--cleanZk|--cleanHdfs|--cleanAll)
Options:
    --cleanZk   cleans hbase related data from zookeeper.
    --cleanHdfs cleans hbase related data from hdfs.
    --cleanAll  cleans hbase related data from both zookeeper and hdfs.
\`\`\`

## \`hbase pe\`

The \`hbase pe\` command runs the PerformanceEvaluation tool, which is used for testing.

The PerformanceEvaluation tool accepts many different options and commands. For usage instructions, run the command with no options.

The PerformanceEvaluation tool has received many updates in recent HBase releases, including support for namespaces, support for tags, cell-level ACLs and visibility labels, multiget support for RPC calls, increased sampling sizes, an option to randomly sleep during testing, and ability to "warm up" the cluster before testing starts.

## \`hbase ltt\`

The \`hbase ltt\` command runs the LoadTestTool utility, which is used for testing.

You must specify either \`-init_only\` or at least one of \`-write\`, \`-update\`, or \`-read\`. For general usage instructions, pass the \`-h\` option.

The LoadTestTool has received many updates in recent HBase releases, including support for namespaces, support for tags, cell-level ACLS and visibility labels, testing security-related features, ability to specify the number of regions per server, tests for multi-get RPC calls, and tests relating to replication.

## Pre-Upgrade validator

Pre-Upgrade validator tool can be used to check the cluster for known incompatibilities before upgrading from HBase 1 to HBase 2.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase pre-upgrade command ...
\`\`\`

### Coprocessor validation

HBase supports co-processors for a long time, but the co-processor API can be changed between major releases. Co-processor validator tries to determine whether the old co-processors are still compatible with the actual HBase version.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase pre-upgrade validate-cp [-jar ...] [-class ... | -table ... | -config]
Options:
 -e            Treat warnings as errors.
 -jar <arg>    Jar file/directory of the coprocessor.
 -table <arg>  Table coprocessor(s) to check.
 -class <arg>  Coprocessor class(es) to check.
 -config         Scan jar for observers.
\`\`\`

The co-processor classes can be explicitly declared by \`-class\` option, or they can be obtained from HBase configuration by \`-config\` option. Table level co-processors can be also checked by \`-table\` option. The tool searches for co-processors on its classpath, but it can be extended by the \`-jar\` option. It is possible to test multiple classes with multiple \`-class\`, multiple tables with multiple \`-table\` options as well as adding multiple jars to the classpath with multiple \`-jar\` options.

The tool can report errors and warnings. Errors mean that HBase won't be able to load the coprocessor, because it is incompatible with the current version of HBase. Warnings mean that the co-processors can be loaded, but they won't work as expected. If \`-e\` option is given, then the tool will also fail for warnings.

Please note that this tool cannot validate every aspect of jar files, it just does some static checks.

For example:

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase pre-upgrade validate-cp -jar my-coprocessor.jar -class MyMasterObserver -class MyRegionObserver
\`\`\`

It validates \`MyMasterObserver\` and \`MyRegionObserver\` classes which are located in \`my-coprocessor.jar\`.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase pre-upgrade validate-cp -table .*
\`\`\`

It validates every table level co-processors where the table name matches to \`.*\` regular expression.

### DataBlockEncoding validation

HBase 2.0 removed \`PREFIX_TREE\` Data Block Encoding from column families. For further information please check [*prefix-tree* encoding removed](/docs/upgrading/paths#prefix-tree-encoding-removed-toc). To verify that none of the column families are using incompatible Data Block Encodings in the cluster run the following command.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase pre-upgrade validate-dbe
\`\`\`

This check validates all column families and print out any incompatibilities. For example:

\`\`\`
2018-07-13 09:58:32,028 WARN  [main] tool.DataBlockEncodingValidator: Incompatible DataBlockEncoding for table: t, cf: f, encoding: PREFIX_TREE
\`\`\`

Which means that Data Block Encoding of table \`t\`, column family \`f\` is incompatible. To fix, use \`alter\` command in HBase shell:

\`\`\`ruby
alter 't', { NAME => 'f', DATA_BLOCK_ENCODING => 'FAST_DIFF' }
\`\`\`

Please also validate HFiles, which is described in the next section.

### HFile Content validation

Even though Data Block Encoding is changed from \`PREFIX_TREE\` it is still possible to have HFiles that contain data encoded that way. To verify that HFiles are readable with HBase 2 please use *HFile content validator*.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase pre-upgrade validate-hfile
\`\`\`

The tool will log the corrupt HFiles and details about the root cause. If the problem is about PREFIX\\_TREE encoding it is necessary to change encodings before upgrading to HBase 2.

The following log message shows an example of incorrect HFiles.

\`\`\`text

\`\`\`

#### Fixing PREFIX\\_TREE errors

It's possible to get \`PREFIX_TREE\` errors after changing Data Block Encoding to a supported one. It can happen because there are some HFiles which still encoded with \`PREFIX_TREE\` or there are still some snapshots.

For fixing HFiles, please run a major compaction on the table (it was \`default:t\` according to the log message):

\`\`\`ruby
major_compact 't'
\`\`\`

HFiles can be referenced from snapshots, too. It's the case when the HFile is located under \`archive/data\`. The first step is to determine which snapshot references that HFile (the name of the file was \`29c641ae91c34fc3bee881f45436b6d1\` according to the logs):

\`\`\`bash
for snapshot in $(hbase snapshotinfo -list-snapshots 2> /dev/null | tail -n -1 | cut -f 1 -d \\|);
do
  echo "checking snapshot named '\${snapshot}'";
  hbase snapshotinfo -snapshot "\${snapshot}" -files 2> /dev/null | grep 29c641ae91c34fc3bee881f45436b6d1;
done
\`\`\`

The output of this shell script is:

\`\`\`text
checking snapshot named 't_snap'
   1.0 K t/56be41796340b757eb7fff1eb5e2a905/f/29c641ae91c34fc3bee881f45436b6d1 (archive)
\`\`\`

Which means \`t_snap\` snapshot references the incompatible HFile. If the snapshot is still needed, then it has to be recreated with HBase shell:

\`\`\`text
# creating a new namespace for the cleanup process
create_namespace 'pre_upgrade_cleanup'

# creating a new snapshot
clone_snapshot 't_snap', 'pre_upgrade_cleanup:t'
alter 'pre_upgrade_cleanup:t', { NAME => 'f', DATA_BLOCK_ENCODING => 'FAST_DIFF' }
major_compact 'pre_upgrade_cleanup:t'

# removing the invalid snapshot
delete_snapshot 't_snap'

# creating a new snapshot
snapshot 'pre_upgrade_cleanup:t', 't_snap'

# removing temporary table
disable 'pre_upgrade_cleanup:t'
drop 'pre_upgrade_cleanup:t'
drop_namespace 'pre_upgrade_cleanup'
\`\`\`

## Data Block Encoding Tool

Tests various compression algorithms with different data block encoder for key compression on an existing HFile. Useful for testing, debugging and benchmarking.

You must specify \`-f\` which is the full path of the HFile.

The result shows both the performance (MB/s) of compression/decompression and encoding/decoding, and the data savings on the HFile.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.DataBlockEncodingTool
Usages: hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.DataBlockEncodingTool
Options:
        -f HFile to analyse (REQUIRED)
        -n Maximum number of key/value pairs to process in a single benchmark run.
        -b Whether to run a benchmark to measure read throughput.
        -c If this is specified, no correctness testing will be done.
        -a What kind of compression algorithm use for test. Default value: GZ.
        -t Number of times to run each benchmark. Default value: 12.
        -omit Number of first runs of every benchmark to omit from statistics. Default value: 2.
\`\`\`

## HBase Conf Tool

HBase Conf tool can be used to print out the current value of a configuration. It can be used by passing the configuration key on the command-line.

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.HBaseConfTool <configuration_key>

Similarly to CopyTable, it can be used for partial or entire table data syncing, under same or remote cluster. However, it performs the sync in a more efficient way than CopyTable. Instead of copying all cells in specified row key/time period range, HashTable (the first step) creates hashed indexes for batch of cells on source table and output those as results. On the next stage, SyncTable scans the source table and now calculates hash indexes for table cells, compares these hashes with the outputs of HashTable, then it just scans (and compares) cells for diverging hashes, only updating mismatching cells. This results in less network traffic/data transfers, which can be impacting when syncing large tables on remote clusters."}),`
