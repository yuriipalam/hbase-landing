Please read this chapter carefully, especially the [Basic Prerequisites](basic-prerequisites) to ensure that your HBase testing and deployment goes smoothly. Familiarize yourself with [Support and Testing Expectations](/docs#support-and-testing-expectations) as well.

## Configuration Files

Apache HBase uses the same configuration system as Apache Hadoop. All configuration files are located in the *conf/* directory, which needs to be kept in sync for each node on your cluster.

***backup-masters***\\
Not present by default. A plain-text file which lists hosts on which the Master should start a backup Master process, one host per line.

***hadoop-metrics2-hbase.properties***\\
Used to connect HBase Hadoop's Metrics2 framework. See the [Hadoop Wiki entry](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HADOOP2/HADOOP-6728-MetricsV2) for more information on Metrics2. Contains only commented-out examples by default.

***hbase-env.cmd* and *hbase-env.sh***\\
Script for Windows and Linux / Unix environments to set up the working environment for HBase, including the location of Java, Java options, and other environment variables. The file contains many commented-out examples to provide guidance.

***hbase-policy.xml***\\
The default policy configuration file used by RPC servers to make authorization decisions on client requests. Only used if HBase [security](/docs/security) is enabled.

***hbase-site.xml***\\
The main HBase configuration file. This file specifies configuration options which override HBase's default configuration. You can view (but do not edit) the default configuration file at *hbase-common/src/main/resources/hbase-default.xml*. You can also view the entire effective configuration for your cluster (defaults and overrides) in the **HBase Configuration** tab of the HBase Web UI.

***log4j2.properties***\\
Configuration file for HBase logging via \`log4j2\`.

***regionservers***\\
A plain-text file containing a list of hosts which should run a RegionServer in your HBase cluster. By default, this file contains the single entry \`localhost\`. It should contain a list of hostnames or IP addresses, one per line, and should only contain \`localhost\` if each node in your cluster will run a RegionServer on its \`localhost\` interface.

<Callout type="tip">
  When you edit XML, it is a good idea to use an XML-aware editor to be sure that your syntax is
  correct and your XML is well-formed. You can also use the \`xmllint\` utility to check that your XML
  is well-formed. By default, \`xmllint\` re-flows and prints the XML to standard output. To check for
  well-formedness and only print output if errors exist, use the command \`xmllint -noout
    filename.xml\`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  When running in distributed mode, after you make an edit to an HBase configuration, make sure you
  copy the contents of the *conf/* directory to all nodes of the cluster. HBase will not do this for
  you. Use a configuration management tool for managing and copying the configuration files to your
  nodes. For most configurations, a restart is needed for servers to pick up changes. Dynamic
  configuration is an exception to this, to be described later below.
