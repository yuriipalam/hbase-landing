import{j as e}from"./chunk-OIYGIGL5-BFuAKb0n.js";let o=`Since version \`2.6.0\` HBase supports TLS encryption in server-client and Master-RegionServer communication. [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is a standard cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. HBase TLS implementation works exactly how secure websites are accessed via **https** prefix in a web browser: once established all communication on the channel will be securely hidden from malicious access.

The encryption works at the transport level which means it's independent of the configured authentication method. Secure client access mentioned in the previous section requires Kerberos to be configured and used in HBase authentication, while TLS can be configured with any other SASL mechanism or even with simple client access methods, effectively preventing attackers from eavesdropping the communication. No Kerberos KDC or other complicated infrastructure required.

HBase TLS is based on the Netty library therefore it only works with Netty client and server RPC implementations. Netty's powerful SSL implementation is a great foundation for highly secure and performant communication providing the latest and greatest cryptographic solution at all times.

Since Region Servers effectively work as clients from Master's perspective, TLS supports encrypted communication between cluster members too.

<Callout type="info">
  From version 2.6.0 HBase supports the [Hadoop CredentialProvider API](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.4/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CredentialProviderAPI.html) to avoid storing sensitive information in HBase configuration files. The recommended way of storing keystore / truststore passwords is to use one of the supported credential providers e.g. the local jceks file provider. You can find more information about how to setup credential providers in the Hadoop documentation.

  The CLI interface for accessing the Hadoop Credential Shell is also available in HBase CLI. Type \`hbase credential\` to get help.
</Callout>

## Server side configuration

We need to set up Java key store for the server. Key store is the list of private keys that a server can use to configure TLS encryption. See [TLS wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for further details of the protocol. Add the following configuration to \`hbase-site.xml\` on Master, Region Servers and HBase clients:

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.server.netty.tls.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.rpc.tls.keystore.location</name>
  <value>/path/to/keystore.jks</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

Use \`hbase.rpc.tls.keystore.password\` alias to retrieve key store password from Hadoop credential provider.

<Callout type="info">
  The supported storefile formats are based on the registered security providers and the loader can
  be autodetected from the file extension. If needed, the file format can be explicitly specified
  with the \`hbase.rpc.tls.keystore.type\` property.
</Callout>

## Client side configuration

We need to configure trust store for the client. Trust store contains the list of certificates that the client should trust when doing the handshake with the server. Add the following to \`hbase-site.xml\`.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.rpc.tls.truststore.location</name>
  <value>/path/to/truststore.jks</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

Use \`hbase.rpc.tls.truststore.password\` alias to retrieve trust store password from Hadoop credential provider.

<Callout type="info">
  The supported storefile formats are based on the registered security providers and the loader can
  be autodetected from the file extension. If needed, the file format can be explicitly specified
  with the \`hbase.rpc.tls.truststore.type\` property.
</Callout>

However, specifying a trust store is not always required. Standard JDK implementations are shipped with a standard list of trusted certificates (the certificates of Certificate Authorities) and if your private key is provided by one of them, you don't need to configure your clients to trust it. Similarly to an internet browser, you don't need to set up the certificates of every single website you're planning to visit. Later in this documentation we'll walk through the steps of creating self-signed certificates which requires a trust store setup.

You can check the list of public certificate authorities shipped with your JDK implementation:

\`\`\`bash
keytool -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -list
\`\`\`

Password is empty by default.

## Creating self-signed certificates

While obtaining globally trusted certificates from Certificate Authorities is convenient, it's perfectly valid to generate your own private/public keypairs and set them up specifically for the HBase cluster. Especially if you don't want to enable public access to the cluster, paying money for a certificate doesn't make sense.

Follow the following steps to generate self-signed certificates.

1. Create SSL key store JKS to store local credentials

   Please note that the alias (-alias) and the distinguished name (-dname) must match the hostname of the machine that is associated with, otherwise hostname verification won't work.

   \`\`\`bash
   keytool -genkeypair -alias $(hostname -f) -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -dname "cn=$(hostname -f)" -keypass password -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password
   \`\`\`

   At the end of this operation you'll have as many key store files as many servers you have in your cluster. Each cluster member will have its own key store.

2. Extract the signed public key (certificate) from each key store

   \`\`\`bash
   keytool -exportcert -alias $(hostname -f) -keystore keystore.jks -file $(hostname -f).cer -rfc
   \`\`\`

3. Create SSL trust store JKS containing certificates for the clients

   The same truststore (storing all accepted certs) should be shared on participants of the cluster. You need to use different aliases to store multiple certificates in the same truststore. Name of the aliases doesn't matter.

   \`\`\`bash
   keytool -importcert -alias [host1..3] -file [host1..3].cer -keystore truststore.jks -storepass password
   \`\`\`

## Upgrading existing non-TLS cluster with no downtime

Here are the steps needed to upgrade an already running HBase cluster to TLS without downtime by taking advantage of port unification functionality. There's a property on server side called \`hbase.server.netty.tls.supportplaintext\` which makes possible to accept TLS and plaintext connections on the same socket port.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create the necessary key stores and trust stores for all server participants as described in the previous section.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Enable secure communication on the Master node in *server-only* mode with plaintext support

    \`\`\`xml
    <property>
      <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.enabled</name>
      <value>false</value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>hbase.server.netty.tls.enabled</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>hbase.server.netty.tls.supportplaintext</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    ...keystore / truststore setup ...
    \`\`\`

    Restart the Master. Master now accepts both TLS/non-TLS connections and works with non-TLS in client mode.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Enable secure communication on the Region Servers in both *server and client* mode with plaintext support

    Client mode here will ensure that RegionServer's communication to Master is encrypted.

    <Callout type="warn">
      **Replication**

      If you have read replicas enabled in your cluster or replication between two different clusters, you have to break this into two steps. Secure communication has to be enabled on the *server side* first with plaintext support and once all Region Servers are upgraded you can repeat the upgrade by enabling *client side* as well.

      You have to prepare all Region Servers for secure communication before upgrading the client side.
    </Callout>

    \`\`\`xml
    <property>
      <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.enabled</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>hbase.server.netty.tls.enabled</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>hbase.server.netty.tls.supportplaintext</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    ...keystore / truststore setup ...
    \`\`\`

    Restart Region Servers in rolling restart fashion. They send requests with TLS and accept both TLS and non-TLS communication.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Enable secure communication on the clients

    \`\`\`xml
    <property>
      <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.enabled</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    ...truststore setup ...
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Enable client-mode TLS on master and disable plaintext mode

    \`\`\`xml
    <property>
      <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.enabled</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>hbase.server.netty.tls.enabled</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>hbase.server.netty.tls.supportplaintext</name>
      <value>false</value>
    </property>
    \`\`\`

    Restart Master.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Disable plaintext communication on the Region Servers

    Disable plaintext communication on the Region Servers by removing \`supportplaintext\` property. Restart RSs in rolling restart fashion.

    <Callout type="warn">
      Once \`hbase.client.netty.tls.enabled\` is enabled on the server side, the cluster will only be able
      to communicate with other clusters which have TLS enabled. For example, this would impact
      inter-cluster replication.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enable automatic certificate reloading

Certificates usually expire after some time to improve security. In this case we need to replace them by modifying Keystore / Truststore files and HBase processes have to be restarted. In order to avoid that you can enable automatic file change detection and certificate reloading with the following option. Default: false.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.rpc.tls.certReload</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

## Additional configuration

### Enabled protocols

Comma-separated list of TLS protocol versions to enable. Default is empty.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.enabledProtocols</name>
  <value>TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

### Default protocol

Set the default TLS protocol version to use. Default is TLSv1.2. Use this protocol if enabled protocols is not defined.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.protocol</name>
  <value>TLSv1.2</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

### Enabled cipher suites

List of enabled cipher suites in TLS protocol. Useful when you want to disable certain cipher suites due to recent security concerns. Default value is a mix of CBC and GCM ciphers. Due to performance reasons we prefer CBC ciphers for Java 8 and GCM ciphers for Java 9+.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.ciphersuites</name>
  <value>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

### Certificate Revocation Checking

There's a built-in mechanism in JDK's TrustManager which automatically checks certificates for revocation. See [Managing Server Certificates](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19263-01/817-5215/ssl.html#wp19807). Disabled by default.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.clr</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

### Online Certificate Status Protocol

Enables [OCSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) stapling. Please note that not all \`SSLProvider\` implementations support OCSP stapling and an exception will be thrown upon. Disabled by default.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.ocsp</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

### Client handshake timeout

Set the TLS client handshake timeout is milliseconds. Default is 5 seconds.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.client.netty.tls.handshaketimeout</name>
  <value>5000</value>
</property>
