### Major Compaction

Major compactions can be requested via the HBase shell or [Admin.majorCompact](https://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/Admin.html#majorCompact\\(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TableName\\)).

Note: major compactions do NOT do region merges. See [compaction](/docs/architecture/regions#compaction) for more information about compactions.

### Merge

Merge is a utility that can merge adjoining regions in the same table (see org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.Merge).

\`\`\`bash
$ bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.Merge <tablename> <region1> <region2>
\`\`\`

If you feel you have too many regions and want to consolidate them, Merge is the utility you need. Merge must run be done when the cluster is down. See the [O'Reilly HBase Book](https://web.archive.org/web/20111231002503/http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449396107/performance.html) for an example of usage.

You will need to pass 3 parameters to this application. The first one is the table name. The second one is the fully qualified name of the first region to merge, like "table\\_name,\\x0A,1342956111995.7cef47f192318ba7ccc75b1bbf27a82b.". The third one is the fully qualified name for the second region to merge.

Additionally, there is a Ruby script attached to [HBASE-1621](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1621) for region merging.

## Capacity Planning and Region Sizing

There are several considerations when planning the capacity for an HBase cluster and performing the initial configuration. Start with a solid understanding of how HBase handles data internally.

### Node count and hardware/VM configuration

#### Physical data size

Physical data size on disk is distinct from logical size of your data and is affected by the following:

* Increased by HBase overhead
* See [keyvalue](/docs/architecture/regions#keyvalue) and [keysize](/docs/regionserver-sizing#try-to-minimize-row-and-column-sizes). At least 24 bytes per key-value (cell), can be more. Small keys/values means more relative overhead.
* KeyValue instances are aggregated into blocks, which are indexed. Indexes also have to be stored. Blocksize is configurable on a per-ColumnFamily basis. See [regions.arch](/docs/architecture/regions).
* Decreased by [compression](/docs/compression) and data block encoding, depending on data. You might want to test what compression and encoding (if any) make sense for your data.
* Increased by size of region server \\[wal]/docs/architecture/regionserver#write-ahead-log-wal (usually fixed and negligible - less than half of RS memory size, per RS).
* Increased by HDFS replication - usually x3.

Aside from the disk space necessary to store the data, one RS may not be able to serve arbitrarily large amounts of data due to some practical limits on region count and size (see [ops.capacity.regions](/docs/operational-management/region-and-capacity#determining-region-count-and-size)).

#### Read/Write throughput

Number of nodes can also be driven by required throughput for reads and/or writes. The throughput one can get per node depends a lot on data (esp. key/value sizes) and request patterns, as well as node and system configuration. Planning should be done for peak load if it is likely that the load would be the main driver of the increase of the node count. PerformanceEvaluation and [ycsb](/docs/ycsb) tools can be used to test single node or a test cluster.

For write, usually 5-15Mb/s per RS can be expected, since every region server has only one active WAL. There's no good estimate for reads, as it depends vastly on data, requests, and cache hit rate. [perf.casestudy](/docs/performance#performance-case-studies) might be helpful.

#### JVM GC limitations

RS cannot currently utilize very large heap due to cost of GC. There's also no good way of running multiple RS-es per server (other than running several VMs per machine). Thus, \\~20-24Gb or less memory dedicated to one RS is recommended. GC tuning is required for large heap sizes. See [gcpause](/docs/performance#long-gc-pauses), [trouble.log.gc](/docs/troubleshooting#jvm-garbage-collection-logs) and elsewhere (TODO: where?)

### Determining region count and size

Generally less regions makes for a smoother running cluster (you can always manually split the big regions later (if necessary) to spread the data, or request load, over the cluster); 20-200 regions per RS is a reasonable range. The number of regions cannot be configured directly (unless you go for fully [disable.splitting](/docs/configuration/important#managed-splitting)); adjust the region size to achieve the target region size given table size.

When configuring regions for multiple tables, note that most region settings can be set on a per-table basis via [TableDescriptorBuilder](https://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/TableDescriptorBuilder.html), as well as shell commands. These settings will override the ones in \`hbase-site.xml\`. That is useful if your tables have different workloads/use cases.

Also note that in the discussion of region sizes here, *HDFS replication factor is not (and should not be) taken into account, whereas other factors [ops.capacity.nodes.datasize](/docs/operational-management/region-and-capacity#physical-data-size) should be.* So, if your data is compressed and replicated 3 ways by HDFS, "9 Gb region" means 9 Gb of compressed data. HDFS replication factor only affects your disk usage and is invisible to most HBase code.

#### Viewing the Current Number of Regions

You can view the current number of regions for a given table using the HMaster UI. In the **Tables** section, the number of online regions for each table is listed in the **Online Regions** column. This total only includes the in-memory state and does not include disabled or offline regions.

#### Number of regions per RS - upper bound

In production scenarios, where you have a lot of data, you are normally concerned with the maximum number of regions you can have per server. [too many regions](/docs/architecture/regions#why-should-i-keep-my-region-count-low) has technical discussion on the subject. Basically, the maximum number of regions is mostly determined by memstore memory usage. Each region has its own memstores; these grow up to a configurable size; usually in 128-256 MB range, see [hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size](/docs/configuration/default#hbasehregionmemstoreflushsize-toc). One memstore exists per column family (so there's only one per region if there's one CF in the table). The RS dedicates some fraction of total memory to its memstores (see [hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size](/docs/configuration/default#hbaseregionserverglobalmemstoresize-toc)). If this memory is exceeded (too much memstore usage), it can cause undesirable consequences such as unresponsive server or compaction storms. A good starting point for the number of regions per RS (assuming one table) is:

\`\`\`text
((RS memory) * (total memstore fraction)) / ((memstore size)*(# column families))
\`\`\`

This formula is pseudo-code. Here are two formulas using the actual tunable parameters, first for HBase 0.98+ and second for HBase 0.94.x.

**HBase 0.98.x**

\`\`\`text
((RS Xmx) * hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size) / (hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size * (# column families))
\`\`\`

**HBase 0.94.x**

\`\`\`text
((RS Xmx) * hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.upperLimit) / (hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size * (# column families))+
\`\`\`

If a given RegionServer has 16 GB of RAM, with default settings, the formula works out to 16384\\*0.4/128 \\~ 51 regions per RS is a starting point. The formula can be extended to multiple tables; if they all have the same configuration, just use the total number of families.

This number can be adjusted; the formula above assumes all your regions are filled at approximately the same rate. If only a fraction of your regions are going to be actively written to, you can divide the result by that fraction to get a larger region count. Then, even if all regions are written to, all region memstores are not filled evenly, and eventually jitter appears even if they are (due to limited number of concurrent flushes). Thus, one can have as many as 2-3 times more regions than the starting point; however, increased numbers carry increased risk.

For write-heavy workload, memstore fraction can be increased in configuration at the expense of block cache; this will also allow one to have more regions.

#### Number of regions per RS - lower bound

HBase scales by having regions across many servers. Thus if you have 2 regions for 16GB data, on a 20 node machine your data will be concentrated on just a few machines - nearly the entire cluster will be idle. This really can't be stressed enough, since a common problem is loading 200MB data into HBase and then wondering why your awesome 10 node cluster isn't doing anything.

On the other hand, if you have a very large amount of data, you may also want to go for a larger number of regions to avoid having regions that are too large.

#### Maximum region size

For large tables in production scenarios, maximum region size is mostly limited by compactions - very large compactions, esp. major, can degrade cluster performance. Currently, the recommended maximum region size is 10-20Gb, and 5-10Gb is optimal. For older 0.90.x codebase, the upper-bound of regionsize is about 4Gb, with a default of 256Mb.

The size at which the region is split into two is generally configured via [hbase.hregion.max.filesize](/docs/configuration/default#hbasehregionmaxfilesize-toc); for details, see [arch.region.splits](/docs/architecture/regions#region-splits).

If you cannot estimate the size of your tables well, when starting off, it's probably best to stick to the default region size, perhaps going smaller for hot tables (or manually split hot regions to spread the load over the cluster), or go with larger region sizes if your cell sizes tend to be largish (100k and up).

In HBase 0.98, experimental stripe compactions feature was added that would allow for larger regions, especially for log data. See [ops.stripe](/docs/architecture/regions#experimental-stripe-compactions).

#### Total data size per region server

According to above numbers for region size and number of regions per region server, in an optimistic estimate 10 GB x 100 regions per RS will give up to 1TB served per region server, which is in line with some of the reported multi-PB use cases. However, it is important to think about the data vs cache size ratio at the RS level. With 1TB of data per server and 10 GB block cache, only 1% of the data will be cached, which may barely cover all block indices.

### Initial configuration and tuning

First, see [important configurations](/docs/configuration/important). Note that some configurations, more than others, depend on specific scenarios. Pay special attention to:

* [hbase.regionserver.handler.count](/docs/configuration/default#hbaseregionserverhandlercount-toc) - request handler thread count, vital for high-throughput workloads.
* [config.wals](/docs/configuration/important#configuring-the-size-and-number-of-wal-files) - the blocking number of WAL files depends on your memstore configuration and should be set accordingly to prevent potential blocking when doing high volume of writes.

Then, there are some considerations when setting up your cluster and tables.

#### Compactions

Depending on read/write volume and latency requirements, optimal compaction settings may be different. See [compaction](/docs/architecture/regions#compaction) for some details.

When provisioning for large data sizes, however, it's good to keep in mind that compactions can affect write throughput. Thus, for write-intensive workloads, you may opt for less frequent compactions and more store files per regions. Minimum number of files for compactions (\`hbase.hstore.compaction.min\`) can be set to higher value; [hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles](/docs/configuration/default#hbasehstoreblockingStoreFiles-toc) should also be increased, as more files might accumulate in such case. You may also consider manually managing compactions: [managed.compactions](/docs/configuration/important#managed-compactions)

#### Pre-splitting the table

Based on the target number of the regions per RS (see [ops.capacity.regions.count](/docs/operational-management/region-and-capacity#number-of-regions-per-rs---upper-bound)) and number of RSes, one can pre-split the table at creation time. This would both avoid some costly splitting as the table starts to fill up, and ensure that the table starts out already distributed across many servers.

If the table is expected to grow large enough to justify that, at least one region per RS should be created. It is not recommended to split immediately into the full target number of regions (e.g. 50 \\* number of RSes), but a low intermediate value can be chosen. For multiple tables, it is recommended to be conservative with presplitting (e.g. pre-split 1 region per RS at most), especially if you don't know how much each table will grow. If you split too much, you may end up with too many regions, with some tables having too many small regions.

For pre-splitting howto, see [manual region splitting decisions](/docs/architecture/regions#manual-region-splitting) and [precreate.regions](/docs/performance#table-creation-pre-creating-regions).

## RegionServer Grouping

RegionServer Grouping (A.K.A \`rsgroup\`) is an advanced feature for partitioning regionservers into distinctive groups for strict isolation. It should only be used by users who are sophisticated enough to understand the full implications and have a sufficient background in managing HBase clusters. It was developed by Yahoo! and they run it at scale on their large grid cluster. See [HBase at Yahoo! Scale](http://www.slideshare.net/HBaseCon/keynote-apache-hbase-at-yahoo-scale).

RSGroups can be defined and managed with both admin methods and shell commands. A server can be added to a group with hostname and port pair and tables can be moved to this group so that only regionservers in the same rsgroup can host the regions of the table. The group for a table is stored in its TableDescriptor, the property name is \`hbase.rsgroup.name\`. You can also set this property on a namespace, so it will cause all the tables under this namespace to be placed into this group. RegionServers and tables can only belong to one rsgroup at a time. By default, all tables and regionservers belong to the \`default\` rsgroup. System tables can also be put into a rsgroup using the regular APIs. A custom balancer implementation tracks assignments per rsgroup and makes sure to move regions to the relevant regionservers in that rsgroup. The rsgroup information is stored in a regular HBase table, and a zookeeper-based read-only cache is used at cluster bootstrap time.

To enable, add the following to your hbase-site.xml and restart your Master:

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.balancer.rsgroup.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

Then use the admin/shell *rsgroup* methods/commands to create and manipulate RegionServer groups: e.g. to add a rsgroup and then add a server to it. To see the list of rsgroup commands available in the hbase shell type:

\`\`\`bash
 hbase(main):008:0> help 'rsgroup'
 Took 0.5610 seconds
\`\`\`

High level, you create a rsgroup that is other than the \`default\` group using *add\\_rsgroup* command. You then add servers and tables to this group with the *move\\_servers\\_rsgroup* and *move\\_tables\\_rsgroup* commands. If necessary, run a balance for the group if tables are slow to migrate to the groups dedicated server with the *balance\\_rsgroup* command (Usually this is not needed). To monitor effect of the commands, see the \`Tables\` tab toward the end of the Master UI home page. If you click on a table, you can see what servers it is deployed across. You should see here a reflection of the grouping done with your shell commands. View the master log if issues.

Here is example using a few of the rsgroup commands. To add a group, do as follows:

\`\`\`bash
 hbase(main):008:0> add_rsgroup 'my_group'
 Took 0.5610 seconds
\`\`\`

<Callout type="info" title="RegionServer Groups must be Enabled">
  If you have not enabled the rsgroup feature and you call any of the rsgroup admin methods or shell
  commands the call will fail with a \`DoNotRetryIOException\` with a detail message that says the
  rsgroup feature is disabled.
</Callout>

Add a server (specified by hostname + port) to the just-made group using the *move\\_servers\\_rsgroup* command as follows:

\`\`\`bash
 hbase(main):010:0> move_servers_rsgroup 'my_group',['k.att.net:51129']
\`\`\`

<Callout type="info" title="Hostname and Port vs ServerName">
  The rsgroup feature refers to servers in a cluster with hostname and port only. It does not make
  use of the HBase ServerName type identifying RegionServers; i.e. hostname + port + starttime to
  distinguish RegionServer instances. The rsgroup feature keeps working across RegionServer restarts
  so the starttime of ServerName — and hence the ServerName type — is not appropriate.
  Administration
</Callout>

Servers come and go over the lifetime of a Cluster. Currently, you must manually align the servers referenced in rsgroups with the actual state of nodes in the running cluster. What we mean by this is that if you decommission a server, then you must update rsgroups as part of your server decommission process removing references. Notice that, by calling \`clearDeadServers\` manually will also remove the dead servers from any rsgroups, but the problem is that we will lost track of the dead servers after master restarts, which means you still need to update the rsgroup by your own.

Please use \`Admin.removeServersFromRSGroup\` or shell command *remove\\_servers\\_rsgroup* to remove decommission servers from rsgroup.

The \`default\` group is not like other rsgroups in that it is dynamic. Its server list mirrors the current state of the cluster; i.e. if you shutdown a server that was part of the \`default\` rsgroup, and then do a *get\\_rsgroup* \`default\` to list its content in the shell, the server will no longer be listed. For non-default groups, though a mode may be offline, it will persist in the non-default group's list of servers. But if you move the offline server from the non-default rsgroup to default, it will not show in the \`default\` list. It will just be dropped.

### Best Practice

The authors of the rsgroup feature, the Yahoo! HBase Engineering team, have been running it on their grid for a good while now and have come up with a few best practices informed by their experience.

#### Isolate System Tables

Either have a system rsgroup where all the system tables are or just leave the system tables in \`default\` rsgroup and have all user-space tables are in non-default rsgroups.

#### Dead Nodes

Yahoo! Have found it useful at their scale to keep a special rsgroup of dead or questionable nodes; this is one means of keeping them out of the running until repair.

Be careful replacing dead nodes in an rsgroup. Ensure there are enough live nodes before you start moving out the dead. Move in good live nodes first if you have to.

### Troubleshooting

Viewing the Master log will give you insight on rsgroup operation.

If it appears stuck, restart the Master process.

### Remove RegionServer Grouping

Simply disable RegionServer Grouping feature is easy, just remove the 'hbase.balancer.rsgroup.enabled' from hbase-site.xml or explicitly set it to false in hbase-site.xml.

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.balancer.rsgroup.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>
\`\`\`

But if you change the 'hbase.balancer.rsgroup.enabled' to true, the old rsgroup configs will take effect again. So if you want to completely remove the RegionServer Grouping feature from a cluster, so that if the feature is re-enabled in the future, the old meta data will not affect the functioning of the cluster, there are more steps to do.

* Move all tables in non-default rsgroups to \`default\` regionserver group

  \`\`\`text
  #Reassigning table t1 from non default group - hbase shell
  hbase(main):005:0> move_tables_rsgroup 'default',['t1']
  \`\`\`

* Move all regionservers in non-default rsgroups to \`default\` regionserver group

  \`\`\`text
  #Reassigning all the servers in the non-default rsgroup to default - hbase shell
  hbase(main):008:0> move_servers_rsgroup 'default',['rs1.xxx.com:16206','rs2.xxx.com:16202','rs3.xxx.com:16204']
  \`\`\`

* Remove all non-default rsgroups. \`default\` rsgroup created implicitly doesn't have to be removed

  \`\`\`text
  #removing non default rsgroup - hbase shell
  hbase(main):009:0> remove_rsgroup 'group2'
  \`\`\`

* Remove the changes made in \`hbase-site.xml\` and restart the cluster

* Drop the table \`hbase:rsgroup\` from \`hbase\`

  \`\`\`text
  #Through hbase shell drop table hbase:rsgroup
  hbase(main):001:0> disable 'hbase:rsgroup'
  0 row(s) in 2.6270 seconds

  hbase(main):002:0> drop 'hbase:rsgroup'
  0 row(s) in 1.2730 seconds
  \`\`\`

* Remove znode \`rsgroup\` from the cluster ZooKeeper using zkCli.sh

  \`\`\`text
  #From ZK remove the node /hbase/rsgroup through zkCli.sh
  rmr /hbase/rsgroup
  \`\`\`

### ACL

To enable ACL, add the following to your hbase-site.xml and restart your Master:

\`\`\`xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.security.authorization</name>
  <value>true</value>
<property>
\`\`\`

### Migrating From Old Implementation

The coprocessor \`org.apache.hadoop.hbase.rsgroup.RSGroupAdminEndpoint\` is deprected, but for compatible, if you want the pre 3.0.0 hbase client/shell to communicate with the new hbase cluster, you still need to add this coprocessor to master.

The \`hbase.rsgroup.grouploadbalancer.class\` config has been deprecated, as now the top level load balancer will always be \`RSGroupBasedLoadBalaner\`, and the \`hbase.master.loadbalancer.class\` config is for configuring the balancer within a group. This also means you should not set \`hbase.master.loadbalancer.class\` to \`RSGroupBasedLoadBalaner\` any more even if rsgroup feature is enabled.

And we have done some special changes for compatibility. First, if coprocessor \`org.apache.hadoop.hbase.rsgroup.RSGroupAdminEndpoint\` is specified, the \`hbase.balancer.rsgroup.enabled\` flag will be set to true automatically to enable rs group feature. Second, we will load \`hbase.rsgroup.grouploadbalancer.class\` prior to \`hbase.master.loadbalancer.class\`. And last, if you do not set \`hbase.rsgroup.grouploadbalancer.class\` but only set \`hbase.master.loadbalancer.class\` to \`RSGroupBasedLoadBalancer\`, we will load the default load balancer to avoid infinite nesting. This means you do not need to change anything when upgrading if you have already enabled rs group feature.

The main difference comparing to the old implementation is that, now the rsgroup for a table is stored in \`TableDescriptor\`, instead of in \`RSGroupInfo\`, so the \`getTables\` method of \`RSGroupInfo\` has been deprecated. And if you use the \`Admin\` methods to get the \`RSGroupInfo\`, its \`getTables\` method will always return empty. This is because that in the old implementation, this method is a bit broken as you can set rsgroup on namespace and make all the tables under this namespace into this group but you can not get these tables through \`RSGroupInfo.getTables\`. Now you should use the two new methods \`listTablesInRSGroup\` and \`getConfiguredNamespacesAndTablesInRSGroup\` in \`Admin\` to get tables and namespaces in a rsgroup.

Of course the behavior for the old RSGroupAdminEndpoint is not changed, we will fill the tables field of the RSGroupInfo before returning, to make it compatible with old hbase client/shell.

When upgrading, the migration between the RSGroupInfo and TableDescriptor will be done automatically. It will take sometime, but it is fine to restart master in the middle, the migration will continue after restart. And during the migration, the rs group feature will still work and in most cases the region will not be misplaced(since this is only a one time job and will not last too long so we have not test it very seriously to make sure the region will not be misplaced always, so we use the word 'in most cases'). The implementation is a bit tricky, you can see the code in \`RSGroupInfoManagerImpl.migrate\` if interested.

## Region Normalizer

The Region Normalizer tries to make Regions all in a table about the same in size. It does this by first calculating total table size and average size per region. It splits any region that is larger than twice this size. Any region that is much smaller is merged into an adjacent region. The Normalizer runs on a regular schedule, which is configurable. It can also be disabled entirely via a runtime "switch". It can be run manually via the shell or Admin API call. Even if normally disabled, it is good to run manually after the cluster has been running a while or say after a burst of activity such as a large delete.

The Normalizer works well for bringing a table's region boundaries into alignment with the reality of data distribution after an initial effort at pre-splitting a table. It is also a nice compliment to the data TTL feature when the schema includes timestamp in the rowkey, as it will automatically merge away regions whose contents have expired.

(The bulk of the below detail was copied wholesale from the blog by Romil Choksi at [HBase Region Normalizer](https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Community-Articles/HBase-Region-Normalizer/ta-p/247266)).

The Region Normalizer is feature available since HBase-1.2. It runs a set of pre-calculated merge/split actions to resize regions that are either too large or too small compared to the average region size for a given table. Region Normalizer when invoked computes a normalization 'plan' for all of the tables in HBase. System tables (such as hbase:meta, hbase:namespace, Phoenix system tables etc) and user tables with normalization disabled are ignored while computing the plan. For normalization enabled tables, normalization plan is carried out in parallel across multiple tables.

Normalizer can be enabled or disabled globally for the entire cluster using the ‘normalizer\\_switch' command in the HBase shell. Normalization can also be controlled on a per table basis, which is disabled by default when a table is created. Normalization for a table can be enabled or disabled by setting the NORMALIZATION\\_ENABLED table attribute to true or false.

To check normalizer status and enable/disable normalizer

\`\`\`bash
hbase(main):001:0> normalizer_enabled
true
0 row(s) in 0.4870 seconds

hbase(main):002:0> normalizer_switch false
true
0 row(s) in 0.0640 seconds

hbase(main):003:0> normalizer_enabled
false
0 row(s) in 0.0120 seconds

hbase(main):004:0> normalizer_switch true
false
0 row(s) in 0.0200 seconds

hbase(main):005:0> normalizer_enabled
true
0 row(s) in 0.0090 seconds
\`\`\`

When enabled, Normalizer is invoked in the background every 5 mins (by default), which can be configured using \`hbase.normalization.period\` in \`hbase-site.xml\`. Normalizer can also be invoked manually/programmatically at will using HBase shell's \`normalize\` command. HBase by default uses \`SimpleRegionNormalizer\`, but users can design their own normalizer as long as they implement the RegionNormalizer Interface. Details about the logic used by \`SimpleRegionNormalizer\` to compute its normalization plan can be found [here](https://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/normalizer/SimpleRegionNormalizer.html).

The below example shows a normalization plan being computed for an user table, and merge action being taken as a result of the normalization plan computed by SimpleRegionNormalizer.

Consider an user table with some pre-split regions having 3 equally large regions (about 100K rows) and 1 relatively small region (about 25K rows). Following is the snippet from an hbase meta table scan showing each of the pre-split regions for the user table.

Invoking the normalizer using 'normalize' int the HBase shell, the below log snippet from HMaster log shows the normalization plan computed as per the logic defined for SimpleRegionNormalizer. Since the total region size (in MB) for the adjacent smallest regions in the table is less than the average region size, the normalizer computes a plan to merge these two regions.

A similar example can be seen for an user table with 3 smaller regions and 1 relatively large region. For this example, we have an user table with 1 large region containing 100K rows, and 3 relatively smaller regions with about 33K rows each. As seen from the normalization plan, since the larger region is more than twice the average region size it ends being split into two regions – one with start key as ‘1' and end key as ‘154717' and the other region with start key as '154717' and end key as ‘3'

## Auto Region Reopen

We can leak store reader references if a coprocessor or core function somehow opens a scanner, or wraps one, and then does not take care to call close on the scanner or the wrapped instance. Leaked store files can not be removed even after it is invalidated via compaction. A reasonable mitigation for a reader reference leak would be a fast reopen of the region on the same server. This will release all resources, like the refcount, leases, etc. The clients should gracefully ride over this like any other region in transition. By default this auto reopen of region feature would be disabled. To enabled it, please provide high ref count value for config \`hbase.regions.recovery.store.file.ref.count\`.

Please refer to config descriptions for \`hbase.master.regions.recovery.check.interval\` and \`hbase.regions.recovery.store.file.ref.count\`.
