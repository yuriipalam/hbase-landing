### Node Decommission

You can stop an individual RegionServer by running the following script in the HBase directory on the particular node:

\`\`\`bash
$ ./bin/hbase-daemon.sh stop regionserver
\`\`\`

The RegionServer will first close all regions and then shut itself down. On shutdown, the RegionServer's ephemeral node in ZooKeeper will expire. The master will notice the RegionServer gone and will treat it as a 'crashed' server; it will reassign the nodes the RegionServer was carrying.

<Callout type="info" title="Disable the Load Balancer before Decommissioning a node">
  If the load balancer runs while a node is shutting down, then there could be contention between
  the Load Balancer and the Master's recovery of the just decommissioned RegionServer. Avoid any
  problems by disabling the balancer first. See the "Load Balancer" info section below.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Kill Node Tool">
  In hbase-2.0, in the bin directory, we added a script named *considerAsDead.sh* that can be used
  to kill a regionserver. Hardware issues could be detected by specialized monitoring tools before
  the zookeeper timeout has expired. *considerAsDead.sh* is a simple function to mark a RegionServer
  as dead. It deletes all the znodes of the server, starting the recovery process. Plug in the
  script into your monitoring/fault detection tools to initiate faster failover. Be careful how you
  use this disruptive tool. Copy the script if you need to make use of it in a version of hbase
  previous to hbase-2.0.
</Callout>

A downside to the above stop of a RegionServer is that regions could be offline for a good period of time. Regions are closed in order. If many regions on the server, the first region to close may not be back online until all regions close and after the master notices the RegionServer's znode gone. A node can be asked to gradually shed its load and then shutdown itself using the *graceful\\_stop.sh* script. Here is its usage:

\`\`\`
$ ./bin/graceful_stop.sh
Usage: graceful_stop.sh [--config <conf-dir>] [-e] [--restart [--reload]] [--thrift] [--rest] [-n |--noack] [--maxthreads <number of threads>] [--movetimeout <timeout in seconds>] [-nob |--nobalancer] [-d |--designatedfile <file path>] [-x |--excludefile <file path>] <hostname>
 thrift         If we should stop/start thrift before/after the hbase stop/start
 rest           If we should stop/start rest before/after the hbase stop/start

 reload         Move offloaded regions back on to the restarted server
 n|noack        Enable noAck mode in RegionMover. This is a best effort mode for moving regions
 maxthreads xx  Limit the number of threads used by the region mover. Default value is 1.
 movetimeout xx Timeout for moving regions. If regions are not moved by the timeout value,exit with error. Default value is INT_MAX.
 hostname       Hostname of server we are to stop
 e|failfast     Set -e so exit immediately if any command exits with non-zero status
 nob|nobalancer Do not manage balancer states. This is only used as optimization in rolling_restart.sh to avoid multiple calls to hbase shell
 d|designatedfile xx Designated file with <hostname:port> per line as unload targets
 x|excludefile xx Exclude file should have <hostname:port> per line. We do not unload regions to hostnames given in exclude file
\`\`\`

To decommission a loaded RegionServer, run the following: \\$ ./bin/graceful\\_stop.sh HOSTNAME where \`HOSTNAME\` is the host carrying the RegionServer you would decommission.

<Callout type="info" title="On HOSTNAME">
  The \`HOSTNAME\` passed to *graceful\\_stop.sh* must match the hostname that hbase is using to
  identify RegionServers. HBase uses fully-qualified domain names usually. Check the list of
  RegionServers in the master UI for how HBase is referring to servers. Whatever HBase is using,
  this is what you should pass the *graceful\\_stop.sh* decommission script. If you pass IPs, the
  script is not yet smart enough to make a hostname (or FQDN) of it and so it will fail when it
  checks if server is currently running; the graceful unloading of regions will not run.
</Callout>

The *graceful\\_stop.sh* script will move the regions off the decommissioned RegionServer one at a time to minimize region churn. It will verify the region deployed in the new location before it will moves the next region and so on until the decommissioned server is carrying zero regions. At this point, the *graceful\\_stop.sh* tells the RegionServer \`stop\`. The master will at this point notice the RegionServer gone but all regions will have already been redeployed and because the RegionServer went down cleanly, there will be no WAL logs to split.

<Callout type="info" title="Load Balancer">
  It is assumed that the Region Load Balancer is disabled while the \`graceful_stop\` script runs (otherwise the balancer and the decommission script will end up fighting over region deployments). Use the shell to disable the balancer:

  \`\`\`ruby
  hbase(main):001:0> balance_switch false
  true
  0 row(s) in 0.3590 seconds
  \`\`\`

  This turns the balancer OFF. To reenable, do:

  \`\`\`ruby
  hbase(main):001:0> balance_switch true
  false
  0 row(s) in 0.3590 seconds
  \`\`\`

  The \`graceful_stop\` will check the balancer and if enabled, will turn it off before it goes to work. If it exits prematurely because of error, it will not have reset the balancer. Hence, it is better to manage the balancer apart from \`graceful_stop\` reenabling it after you are done w/ graceful\\_stop.
</Callout>

#### Decommissioning several Regions Servers concurrently

If you have a large cluster, you may want to decommission more than one machine at a time by gracefully stopping multiple RegionServers concurrently. To gracefully drain multiple regionservers at the same time, RegionServers can be put into a "draining" state. This is done by marking a RegionServer as a draining node by creating an entry in ZooKeeper under the *hbase\\_root/draining* znode. This znode has format \`name,port,startcode\` just like the regionserver entries under *hbase\\_root/rs* znode.

Without this facility, decommissioning multiple nodes may be non-optimal because regions that are being drained from one region server may be moved to other regionservers that are also draining. Marking RegionServers to be in the draining state prevents this from happening. See this [blog post](http://inchoate-clatter.blogspot.com/2012/03/hbase-ops-automation.html) for more details.

#### Bad or Failing Disk

It is good having [dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated](/docs/configuration/important#dfsdatanodefailedvolumestolerated) set if you have a decent number of disks per machine for the case where a disk plain dies. But usually disks do the "John Wayne" — i.e. take a while to go down spewing errors in *dmesg* — or for some reason, run much slower than their companions. In this case you want to decommission the disk. You have two options. You can [decommission the datanode](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDataNodeAdminGuide.html) or, less disruptive in that only the bad disks data will be rereplicated, can stop the datanode, unmount the bad volume (You can't umount a volume while the datanode is using it), and then restart the datanode (presuming you have set dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated > 0). The regionserver will throw some errors in its logs as it recalibrates where to get its data from — it will likely roll its WAL log too — but in general but for some latency spikes, it should keep on chugging.

<Callout type="info" title="Short Circuit Reads">
  If you are doing short-circuit reads, you will have to move the regions off the regionserver
  before you stop the datanode; when short-circuiting reading, though chmod'd so regionserver cannot
  have access, because it already has the files open, it will be able to keep reading the file
  blocks from the bad disk even though the datanode is down. Move the regions back after you restart
  the datanode.
</Callout>

### Rolling Restart

Some cluster configuration changes require either the entire cluster, or the RegionServers, to be restarted in order to pick up the changes. In addition, rolling restarts are supported for upgrading to a minor or maintenance release, and to a major release if at all possible. See the release notes for release you want to upgrade to, to find out about limitations to the ability to perform a rolling upgrade.

There are multiple ways to restart your cluster nodes, depending on your situation. These methods are detailed below.

#### Using the \`rolling-restart.sh\` Script

HBase ships with a script, *bin/rolling-restart.sh*, that allows you to perform rolling restarts on the entire cluster, the master only, or the RegionServers only. The script is provided as a template for your own script, and is not explicitly tested. It requires password-less SSH login to be configured and assumes that you have deployed using a tarball. The script requires you to set some environment variables before running it. Examine the script and modify it to suit your needs.

***rolling-restart.sh* General Usage**

\`\`\`bash
$ ./bin/rolling-restart.sh --help
Usage: rolling-restart.sh [--config <hbase-confdir>] [--rs-only] [--master-only] [--graceful] [--maxthreads xx]
\`\`\`

**Rolling Restart on RegionServers Only**\\
To perform a rolling restart on the RegionServers only, use the \`--rs-only\` option. This might be necessary if you need to reboot the individual RegionServer or if you make a configuration change that only affects RegionServers and not the other HBase processes.

**Rolling Restart on Masters Only**\\
To perform a rolling restart on the active and backup Masters, use the \`--master-only\` option. You might use this if you know that your configuration change only affects the Master and not the RegionServers, or if you need to restart the server where the active Master is running.

**Graceful Restart**\\
If you specify the \`--graceful\` option, RegionServers are restarted using the *bin/graceful\\_stop.sh* script, which moves regions off a RegionServer before restarting it. This is safer, but can delay the restart.

Limiting the Number of Threads\\
To limit the rolling restart to using only a specific number of threads, use the \`--maxthreads\` option.

#### Manual Rolling Restart

To retain more control over the process, you may wish to manually do a rolling restart across your cluster. This uses the \`graceful-stop.sh\` command [decommission](/docs/operational-management/node#node-decommission). In this method, you can restart each RegionServer individually and then move its old regions back into place, retaining locality. If you also need to restart the Master, you need to do it separately, and restart the Master before restarting the RegionServers using this method. The following is an example of such a command. You may need to tailor it to your environment. This script does a rolling restart of RegionServers only. It disables the load balancer before moving the regions.

\`\`\`bash
$ for i in \`cat conf/regionservers|sort\`; do ./bin/graceful_stop.sh --restart --reload --debug $i; done &> /tmp/log.txt &;
\`\`\`

Monitor the output of the */tmp/log.txt* file to follow the progress of the script.

#### Logic for Crafting Your Own Rolling Restart Script

Use the following guidelines if you want to create your own rolling restart script.

1. Extract the new release, verify its configuration, and synchronize it to all nodes of your cluster using \`rsync\`, \`scp\`, or another secure synchronization mechanism.

2. Restart the master first. You may need to modify these commands if your new HBase directory is different from the old one, such as for an upgrade.

   \`\`\`bash
   $ ./bin/hbase-daemon.sh stop master; ./bin/hbase-daemon.sh start master
   \`\`\`

3. Gracefully restart each RegionServer, using a script such as the following, from the Master.

   \`\`\`bash
   $ for i in \`cat conf/regionservers|sort\`; do ./bin/graceful_stop.sh --restart --reload --debug $i; done &> /tmp/log.txt &
   \`\`\`

   If you are running Thrift or REST servers, pass the --thrift or --rest options. For other available options, run the \`bin/graceful-stop.sh --help\` command.

   It is important to drain HBase regions slowly when restarting multiple RegionServers. Otherwise, multiple regions go offline simultaneously and must be reassigned to other nodes, which may also go offline soon. This can negatively affect performance. You can inject delays into the script above, for instance, by adding a Shell command such as \`sleep\`. To wait for 5 minutes between each RegionServer restart, modify the above script to the following:

   \`\`\`bash
   $ for i in \`cat conf/regionservers|sort\`; do ./bin/graceful_stop.sh --restart --reload --debug $i & sleep 5m; done &> /tmp/log.txt &
   \`\`\`

4. Restart the Master again, to clear out the dead servers list and re-enable the load balancer.

### Adding a New Node

Adding a new regionserver in HBase is essentially free, you simply start it like this: \`$ ./bin/hbase-daemon.sh start regionserver\` and it will register itself with the master. Ideally you also started a DataNode on the same machine so that the RS can eventually start to have local files. If you rely on ssh to start your daemons, don't forget to add the new hostname in *conf/regionservers* on the master.

At this point the region server isn't serving data because no regions have moved to it yet. If the balancer is enabled, it will start moving regions to the new RS. On a small/medium cluster this can have a very adverse effect on latency as a lot of regions will be offline at the same time. It is thus recommended to disable the balancer the same way it's done when decommissioning a node and move the regions manually (or even better, using a script that moves them one by one).

The moved regions will all have 0% locality and won't have any blocks in cache so the region server will have to use the network to serve requests. Apart from resulting in higher latency, it may also be able to use all of your network card's capacity. For practical purposes, consider that a standard 1GigE NIC won't be able to read much more than *100MB/s*. In this case, or if you are in a OLAP environment and require having locality, then it is recommended to major compact the moved regions.
