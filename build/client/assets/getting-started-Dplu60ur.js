This section describes the setup of a single-node standalone HBase. A *standalone* instance has all HBase daemons — the Master, RegionServers, and ZooKeeper — running in a single JVM persisting to the local filesystem. It is our most basic deploy profile. We will show you how to create a table in HBase using the \`hbase shell\` CLI, insert rows into the table, perform put and scan operations against the table, enable or disable the table, and start and stop HBase.

Apart from downloading HBase, this procedure should take less than 10 minutes.

## JDK Version Requirements

HBase requires that a JDK be installed. See [Java](/docs/configuration/basic-prerequisites#configuration-basic-prerequisites-java) for information about supported JDK versions.

## Get Started with HBase

### Procedure: Download, Configure, and Start HBase in Standalone Mode

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Choose a download site from this list of [Apache Download Mirrors](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/hbase/). Click on the suggested top link. This will take you to a mirror of *HBase Releases*. Click on the folder named *stable* and then download the binary file that ends in *.tar.gz* to your local filesystem. Do not download the file ending in *src.tar.gz* for now.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Extract the downloaded file, and change to the newly-created directory.

    \`\`\`bash
    tar xzvf <FILE_NAME>.tar.gz
    cd <DIRECTORY_NAME>
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    You must set the \`JAVA_HOME\` environment variable before starting HBase. To make this easier, HBase lets you set it within the *conf/hbase-env.sh* file. You must locate where Java is installed on your machine, and one way to find this is by using the *whereis java* command. Once you have the location, edit the *conf/hbase-env.sh* file and uncomment the line starting with *#export JAVA\\_HOME=*, and then set it to your Java installation path.

    *Example extract from *hbase-env.sh* where *JAVA\\_HOME* is set*

    \`\`\`bash
    # Set environment variables here.
    # The java implementation to use.
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_112
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    The *bin/start-hbase.sh* script is provided as a convenient way to start HBase. Issue the command, and if all goes well, a message is logged to standard output showing that HBase started successfully. You can use the \`jps\` command to verify that you have one running process called \`HMaster\`. In standalone mode HBase runs all daemons within this single JVM, i.e. the HMaster, a single HRegionServer, and the ZooKeeper daemon. Go to *[http://localhost:16010](http://localhost:16010)* to view the HBase Web UI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Procedure: Use HBase For the First Time

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Connect to HBase

    Connect to your running instance of HBase using the \`hbase shell\` command, located in the *bin/* directory of your HBase install. In this example, some usage and version information that is printed when you start HBase Shell has been omitted. The HBase Shell prompt ends with a \`>\` character.

    \`\`\`bash
    $ ./bin/hbase shell
    hbase(main):001:0>
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Display HBase Shell Help Text

    Type \`help\` and press Enter, to display some basic usage information for HBase Shell, as well as several example commands. Notice that table names, rows, columns all must be enclosed in quote characters.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Create a table

    Use the \`create\` command to create a new table. You must specify the table name and the ColumnFamily name.

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):001:0> create 'test', 'cf'
    0 row(s) in 0.4170 seconds

    => Hbase::Table - test
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### List Information About your Table

    Use the \`list\` command to confirm your table exists

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):002:0> list 'test'
    TABLE
    test
    1 row(s) in 0.0180 seconds

    => ["test"]
    \`\`\`

    Now use the \`describe\` command to see details, including configuration defaults

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):003:0> describe 'test'
    Table test is ENABLED
    test
    COLUMN FAMILIES DESCRIPTION
    {NAME => 'cf', VERSIONS => '1', EVICT_BLOCKS_ON_CLOSE => 'false', NEW_VERSION_BEHAVIOR => 'false', KEEP_DELETED_CELLS => 'FALSE', CACHE_DATA_ON_WRITE =>
    'false', DATA_BLOCK_ENCODING => 'NONE', TTL => 'FOREVER', MIN_VERSIONS => '0', REPLICATION_SCOPE => '0', BLOOMFILTER => 'ROW', CACHE_INDEX_ON_WRITE => 'f
    alse', IN_MEMORY => 'false', CACHE_BLOOMS_ON_WRITE => 'false', PREFETCH_BLOCKS_ON_OPEN => 'false', COMPRESSION => 'NONE', BLOCKCACHE => 'true', BLOCKSIZE
     => '65536'}
    1 row(s)
    Took 0.9998 seconds
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Put data into your table

    To put data into your table, use the \`put\` command.

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):003:0> put 'test', 'row1', 'cf:a', 'value1'
    0 row(s) in 0.0850 seconds

    hbase(main):004:0> put 'test', 'row2', 'cf:b', 'value2'
    0 row(s) in 0.0110 seconds

    hbase(main):005:0> put 'test', 'row3', 'cf:c', 'value3'
    0 row(s) in 0.0100 seconds
    \`\`\`

    Here, we insert three values, one at a time. The first insert is at \`row1\`, column \`cf:a\`, with a value of \`value1\`. Columns in HBase are comprised of a column family prefix, \`cf\` in this example, followed by a colon and then a column qualifier suffix, \`a\` in this case.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Scan the table for all data at once

    One of the ways to get data from HBase is to scan. Use the \`scan\` command to scan the table for data. You can limit your scan, but for now, all data is fetched.

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):006:0> scan 'test'
    ROW                                      COLUMN+CELL
     row1                                    column=cf:a, timestamp=1421762485768, value=value1
     row2                                    column=cf:b, timestamp=1421762491785, value=value2
     row3                                    column=cf:c, timestamp=1421762496210, value=value3
    3 row(s) in 0.0230 seconds
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Get a single row of data

    To get a single row of data at a time, use the \`get\` command.

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):007:0> get 'test', 'row1'
    COLUMN                                   CELL
     cf:a                                    timestamp=1421762485768, value=value1
    1 row(s) in 0.0350 seconds
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Disable a table

    If you want to delete a table or change its settings, as well as in some other situations, you need to disable the table first, using the \`disable\` command. You can re-enable it using the \`enable\` command.

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):008:0> disable 'test'
    0 row(s) in 1.1820 seconds

    hbase(main):009:0> enable 'test'
    0 row(s) in 0.1770 seconds
    \`\`\`

    Disable the table again if you tested the \`enable\` command above:

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):010:0> disable 'test'
    0 row(s) in 1.1820 seconds
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Drop the table

    To drop (delete) a table, use the \`drop\` command.

    \`\`\`bash
    hbase(main):011:0> drop 'test'
    0 row(s) in 0.1370 seconds
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Exit the HBase Shell

    To exit the HBase Shell and disconnect from your cluster, use the \`quit\` command. HBase is still running in the background.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Procedure: Stop HBase

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In the same way that the *bin/start-hbase.sh* script is provided to conveniently start all HBase daemons, the *bin/stop-hbase.sh* script stops them.

    \`\`\`bash
    $ ./bin/stop-hbase.sh
    stopping hbase....................
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    After issuing the command, it can take several minutes for the processes to shut down. Use the \`jps\` to be sure that the HMaster and HRegionServer processes are shut down.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The above has shown you how to start and stop a standalone instance of HBase. In the next sections we give a quick overview of other modes of hbase deploy.

## Pseudo-Distributed for Local Testing

After working your way through [quickstart](/docs/getting-started#quick-start---standalone-hbase) standalone mode, you can re-configure HBase to run in pseudo-distributed mode. Pseudo-distributed mode means that HBase still runs completely on a single host, but each HBase daemon (HMaster, HRegionServer, and ZooKeeper) runs as a separate process: in standalone mode all daemons ran in one jvm process/instance. By default, unless you configure the \`hbase.rootdir\` property as described in [quickstart](/docs/getting-started#quick-start---standalone-hbase), your data is still stored in */tmp/*. In this walk-through, we store your data in HDFS instead, assuming you have HDFS available. You can skip the HDFS configuration to continue storing your data in the local filesystem.

<Callout type="info">
  This procedure assumes that you have configured Hadoop and HDFS on your local system and/or a
  remote system, and that they are running and available. It also assumes you are using Hadoop 2.
  The guide on [Setting up a Single Node
  Cluster](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)
  in the Hadoop documentation is a good starting point.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Stop HBase if it is running

    If you have just finished [quickstart](/docs/getting-started#quick-start---standalone-hbase) and HBase is still running, stop it. This procedure will create a totally new directory where HBase will store its data, so any databases you created before will be lost.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Configure HBase

    Edit the *hbase-site.xml* configuration. First, add the following property which directs HBase to run in distributed mode, with one JVM instance per daemon.

    \`\`\`xml
    <property>
      <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
    \`\`\`

    Next, add a configuration for \`hbase.rootdir\`, pointing to the address of your HDFS instance, using the \`hdfs:////\` URI syntax. In this example, HDFS is running on the localhost at port 8020.

    \`\`\`xml
    <property>
      <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
      <value>hdfs://localhost:9000/hbase</value>
    </property>
    \`\`\`

    You do not need to create the directory in HDFS. HBase will do this for you. If you create the directory, HBase will attempt to do a migration, which is not what you want.

    Finally, remove existing configuration for \`hbase.tmp.dir\` and \`hbase.unsafe.stream.capability.enforce\`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Start HBase

    Use the *bin/start-hbase.sh* command to start HBase. If your system is configured correctly, the \`jps\` command should show the HMaster and HRegionServer processes running.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Check the HBase directory in HDFS

    If everything worked correctly, HBase created its directory in HDFS. In the configuration above, it is stored in */hbase/* on HDFS. You can use the \`hadoop fs\` command in Hadoop's *bin/* directory to list this directory.

    \`\`\`bash
    $ ./bin/hadoop fs -ls /hbase
    Found 7 items
    drwxr-xr-x   - hbase users          0 2014-06-25 18:58 /hbase/.tmp
    drwxr-xr-x   - hbase users          0 2014-06-25 21:49 /hbase/WALs
    drwxr-xr-x   - hbase users          0 2014-06-25 18:48 /hbase/corrupt
    drwxr-xr-x   - hbase users          0 2014-06-25 18:58 /hbase/data
    -rw-r--r--   3 hbase users         42 2014-06-25 18:41 /hbase/hbase.id
    -rw-r--r--   3 hbase users          7 2014-06-25 18:41 /hbase/hbase.version
    drwxr-xr-x   - hbase users          0 2014-06-25 21:49 /hbase/oldWALs
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Create a table and populate it with data

    You can use the HBase Shell to create a table, populate it with data, scan and get values from it, using the same procedure as in [shell exercises](/docs/getting-started#procedure-use-hbase-for-the-first-time).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Start and stop a backup HBase Master (HMaster) server

    <Callout type="info">
      Running multiple HMaster instances on the same hardware does not make sense in a production
      environment, in the same way that running a pseudo-distributed cluster does not make sense for
      production. This step is offered for testing and learning purposes only.
    </Callout>

    The HMaster server controls the HBase cluster. You can start up to 9 backup HMaster servers, which makes 10 total HMasters, counting the primary. To start a backup HMaster, use the \`local-master-backup.sh\`. For each backup master you want to start, add a parameter representing the port offset for that master. Each HMaster uses two ports (16000 and 16010 by default). The port offset is added to these ports, so using an offset of 2, the backup HMaster would use ports 16002 and 16012. The following command starts 3 backup servers using ports 16002/16012, 16003/16013, and 16005/16015.

    \`\`\`bash
    ./bin/local-master-backup.sh start 2 3 5
    \`\`\`

    To kill a backup master without killing the entire cluster, you need to find its process ID (PID). The PID is stored in a file with a name like */tmp/hbase-USER-X-master.pid*. The only contents of the file is the PID. You can use the \`kill -9\` command to kill that PID. The following command will kill the master with port offset 1, but leave the cluster running:

    \`\`\`bash
    cat /tmp/hbase-testuser-1-master.pid |xargs kill -9
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Start and stop additional RegionServers

    The HRegionServer manages the data in its StoreFiles as directed by the HMaster. Generally, one HRegionServer runs per node in the cluster. Running multiple HRegionServers on the same system can be useful for testing in pseudo-distributed mode. The \`local-regionservers.sh\` command allows you to run multiple RegionServers. It works in a similar way to the \`local-master-backup.sh\` command, in that each parameter you provide represents the port offset for an instance. Each RegionServer requires two ports, and the default ports are 16020 and 16030. Since HBase version 1.1.0, HMaster doesn't use region server ports, this leaves 10 ports (16020 to 16029 and 16030 to 16039) to be used for RegionServers. For supporting additional RegionServers, set environment variables HBASE\\_RS\\_BASE\\_PORT and HBASE\\_RS\\_INFO\\_BASE\\_PORT to appropriate values before running script \`local-regionservers.sh\`. e.g. With values 16200 and 16300 for base ports, 99 additional RegionServers can be supported, on a server. The following command starts four additional RegionServers, running on sequential ports starting at 16022/16032 (base ports 16020/16030 plus 2).

    \`\`\`bash
    ./bin/local-regionservers.sh start 2 3 4 5
    \`\`\`

    To stop a RegionServer manually, use the \`local-regionservers.sh\` command with the \`stop\` parameter and the offset of the server to stop.

    \`\`\`bash
    ./bin/local-regionservers.sh stop 3
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Stop HBase

    You can stop HBase the same way as in the [quickstart](/docs/getting-started#quick-start---standalone-hbase) procedure, using the *bin/stop-hbase.sh* command.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Fully Distributed for Production

In reality, you need a fully-distributed configuration to fully test HBase and to use it in real-world scenarios. In a distributed configuration, the cluster contains multiple nodes, each of which runs one or more HBase daemon. These include primary and backup Master instances, multiple ZooKeeper nodes, and multiple RegionServer nodes.

This advanced quickstart adds two more nodes to your cluster. The architecture will be as follows:

| Node Name          | Master | ZooKeeper | RegionServer |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------- | ------------ |
| node-a.example.com | yes    | yes       | no           |
| node-b.example.com | backup | yes       | yes          |
| node-c.example.com | no     | yes       | yes          |

Distributed Cluster Demo Architecture

This quickstart assumes that each node is a virtual machine and that they are all on the same network. It builds upon the previous quickstart, [Pseudo-Distributed for Local Testing](/docs/getting-started#pseudo-distributed-for-local-testing), assuming that the system you configured in that procedure is now \`node-a\`. Stop HBase on \`node-a\` before continuing.

<Callout type="info">
  Be sure that all the nodes have full access to communicate, and that no firewall rules are in
  place which could prevent them from talking to each other. If you see any errors like \`no route to
    host\`, check your firewall.
</Callout>

### Procedure: Configure Passwordless SSH Access

\`node-a\` needs to be able to log into \`node-b\` and \`node-c\` (and to itself) in order to start the daemons. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use the same username on all hosts, and configure password-less SSH login from \`node-a\` to each of the others.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### On \`node-a\`, generate a key pair

    While logged in as the user who will run HBase, generate a SSH key pair, using the following command:

    \`\`\`bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    \`\`\`

    If the command succeeds, the location of the key pair is printed to standard output. The default name of the public key is *id\\_rsa.pub*.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Create the directory that will hold the shared keys on the other nodes

    On \`node-b\` and \`node-c\`, log in as the HBase user and create a *.ssh/* directory in the user's home directory, if it does not already exist. If it already exists, be aware that it may already contain other keys.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Copy the public key to the other nodes

    Securely copy the public key from \`node-a\` to each of the nodes, by using the \`scp\` or some other secure means. On each of the other nodes, create a new file called *.ssh/authorized\\_keys* *if it does not already exist*, and append the contents of the *id\\_rsa.pub* file to the end of it. Note that you also need to do this for \`node-a\` itself.

    \`\`\`bash
    cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Test password-less login

    If you performed the procedure correctly, you should not be prompted for a password when you SSH from \`node-a\` to either of the other nodes using the same username.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Since \`node-b\` will run a backup Master, repeat the procedure above, substituting \`node-b\` everywhere you see \`node-a\`. Be sure not to overwrite your existing *.ssh/authorized\\_keys* files, but concatenate the new key onto the existing file using the \`>>\` operator rather than the \`>\` operator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Procedure: Prepare \`node-a\`

\`node-a\` will run your primary master and ZooKeeper processes, but no RegionServers. Stop the RegionServer from starting on \`node-a\`.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Edit *conf/regionservers* and remove the line which contains \`localhost\`. Add lines with the hostnames or IP addresses for \`node-b\` and \`node-c\`.

    Even if you did want to run a RegionServer on \`node-a\`, you should refer to it by the hostname the other servers would use to communicate with it. In this case, that would be \`node-a.example.com\`. This enables you to distribute the configuration to each node of your cluster any hostname conflicts. Save the file.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Configure HBase to use \`node-b\` as a backup master

    Create a new file in *conf/* called *backup-masters*, and add a new line to it with the hostname for \`node-b\`. In this demonstration, the hostname is \`node-b.example.com\`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Configure ZooKeeper

    In reality, you should carefully consider your ZooKeeper configuration. You can find out more about configuring ZooKeeper in [zookeeper](/docs/zookeeper) section. This configuration will direct HBase to start and manage a ZooKeeper instance on each node of the cluster.

    On \`node-a\`, edit *conf/hbase-site.xml* and add the following properties.

    \`\`\`xml
    <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>node-a.example.com,node-b.example.com,node-c.example.com</value>
    </property>
    <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
    <value>/usr/local/zookeeper</value>
    </property>
    \`\`\`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Everywhere in your configuration that you have referred to \`node-a\` as \`localhost\`, change the reference to point to the hostname that the other nodes will use to refer to \`node-a\`. In these examples, the hostname is \`node-a.example.com\`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Procedure: Prepare \`node-b\` and \`node-c\`

\`node-b\` will run a backup master server and a ZooKeeper instance.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Download and unpack HBase

    Download and unpack HBase to \`node-b\`, just as you did for the standalone and pseudo-distributed quickstarts.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Copy the configuration files from \`node-a\` to \`node-b\`.and \`node-c\`

    Each node of your cluster needs to have the same configuration information. Copy the contents of the *conf/* directory to the *conf/* directory on \`node-b\` and \`node-c\`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Procedure: Start and Test Your Cluster

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Be sure HBase is not running on any node

    If you forgot to stop HBase from previous testing, you will have errors. Check to see whether HBase is running on any of your nodes by using the \`jps\` command. Look for the processes \`HMaster\`, \`HRegionServer\`, and \`HQuorumPeer\`. If they exist, kill them.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Start the cluster

    On \`node-a\`, issue the \`start-hbase.sh\` command. Your output will be similar to that below.

    \`\`\`bash
    $ bin/start-hbase.sh
    node-c.example.com: starting zookeeper, logging to /home/hbuser/hbase-0.98.3-hadoop2/bin/../logs/hbase-hbuser-zookeeper-node-c.example.com.out
    node-a.example.com: starting zookeeper, logging to /home/hbuser/hbase-0.98.3-hadoop2/bin/../logs/hbase-hbuser-zookeeper-node-a.example.com.out
    node-b.example.com: starting zookeeper, logging to /home/hbuser/hbase-0.98.3-hadoop2/bin/../logs/hbase-hbuser-zookeeper-node-b.example.com.out
    starting master, logging to /home/hbuser/hbase-0.98.3-hadoop2/bin/../logs/hbase-hbuser-master-node-a.example.com.out
    node-c.example.com: starting regionserver, logging to /home/hbuser/hbase-0.98.3-hadoop2/bin/../logs/hbase-hbuser-regionserver-node-c.example.com.out
    node-b.example.com: starting regionserver, logging to /home/hbuser/hbase-0.98.3-hadoop2/bin/../logs/hbase-hbuser-regionserver-node-b.example.com.out
    node-b.example.com: starting master, logging to /home/hbuser/hbase-0.98.3-hadoop2/bin/../logs/hbase-hbuser-master-nodeb.example.com.out
    \`\`\`

    ZooKeeper starts first, followed by the master, then the RegionServers, and finally the backup masters.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Verify that the processes are running

    On each node of the cluster, run the \`jps\` command and verify that the correct processes are running on each server. You may see additional Java processes running on your servers as well, if they are used for other purposes.

      The \`HQuorumPeer\` process is a ZooKeeper instance which is controlled and started by HBase. If you
      use ZooKeeper this way, it is limited to one instance per cluster node and is appropriate for
      testing only. If ZooKeeper is run outside of HBase, the process is called \`QuorumPeer\`. For more
      about ZooKeeper configuration, including using an external ZooKeeper instance with HBase, see
      [zookeeper](/docs/zookeeper) section.

    #### Browse to the Web UI

    If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to connect to the UI for the Master \`http://node-a.example.com:16010/\` or the secondary master at \`http://node-b.example.com:16010/\` using a web browser. If you can connect via \`localhost\` but not from another host, check your firewall rules. You can see the web UI for each of the RegionServers at port 16030 of their IP addresses, or by clicking their links in the web UI for the Master.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Test what happens when nodes or services disappear

    With a three-node cluster you have configured, things will not be very resilient. You can still test the behavior of the primary Master or a RegionServer by killing the associated processes and watching the logs.

The port offset is added to these ports, so using an offset of 2, the backup HMaster would use ports 16002 and 16012.

It works in a similar way to the local-master-backup.sh command, in that each parameter you provide represents the port offset for an instance. Each RegionServer requires two ports, and the default ports are 16020 and 16030. Since HBase version 1.1.0, HMaster doesn't use region server ports, this leaves 10 ports (16020 to 16029 and 16030 to 16039) to be used for RegionServers. For supporting additional RegionServers, set environment variables HBASE_RS_BASE_PORT and HBASE_RS_INFO_BASE_PORT to appropriate values before running script local-regionservers.sh. e.g. With values 16200 and 16300 for base ports, 99 additional RegionServers can be supported, on a server.
