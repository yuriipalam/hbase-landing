import{j as e}from"./chunk-OIYGIGL5-BFuAKb0n.js";let h=`Apache HBase by default manages a ZooKeeper "cluster" for you.
It will start and stop the ZooKeeper ensemble as part of the HBase start/stop process.
You can also manage the ZooKeeper ensemble independent of HBase and just point HBase at the cluster it should use.
To toggle HBase management of ZooKeeper, use the \`HBASE_MANAGES_ZK\` variable in *conf/hbase-env.sh*.
This variable, which defaults to \`true\`, tells HBase whether to start/stop the ZooKeeper ensemble servers as part of HBase start/stop.

When HBase manages the ZooKeeper ensemble, you can specify ZooKeeper configuration directly in *conf/hbase-site.xml*.
A ZooKeeper configuration option can be set as a property in the HBase *hbase-site.xml* XML configuration file by prefacing the ZooKeeper option name with \`hbase.zookeeper.property\`.
For example, the \`clientPort\` setting in ZooKeeper can be changed by setting the \`hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort\` property.
For all default values used by HBase, including ZooKeeper configuration, see [hbase default configurations](/docs/configuration/default#configuration-default-hbase-default-configuration).
Look for the \`hbase.zookeeper.property\` prefix.
For the full list of ZooKeeper configurations, see ZooKeeper's *zoo.cfg*.
HBase does not ship with a *zoo.cfg* so you will need to browse the *conf* directory in an appropriate ZooKeeper download.

You must at least list the ensemble servers in *hbase-site.xml* using the \`hbase.zookeeper.quorum\` property.
This property defaults to a single ensemble member at \`localhost\` which is not suitable for a fully distributed HBase.
(It binds to the local machine only and remote clients will not be able to connect).

<Callout type="info" title="How many ZooKeepers should I run?">
  You can run a ZooKeeper ensemble that comprises 1 node only but in production it is recommended that you run a ZooKeeper ensemble of 3, 5 or 7 machines; the more members an ensemble has, the more tolerant the ensemble is of host failures.
  Also, run an odd number of machines.
  In ZooKeeper, an even number of peers is supported, but it is normally not used because an even sized ensemble requires, proportionally, more peers to form a quorum than an odd sized ensemble requires.
  For example, an ensemble with 4 peers requires 3 to form a quorum, while an ensemble with 5 also requires 3 to form a quorum.
  Thus, an ensemble of 5 allows 2 peers to fail, and thus is more fault tolerant than the ensemble of 4, which allows only 1 down peer.

  Give each ZooKeeper server around 1GB of RAM, and if possible, its own dedicated disk (A dedicated disk is the best thing you can do to ensure a performant ZooKeeper ensemble). For very heavily loaded clusters, run ZooKeeper servers on separate machines from RegionServers (DataNodes and TaskTrackers).
</Callout>

For example, to have HBase manage a ZooKeeper quorum on nodes *rs\\{1,2,3,4,5}.example.com*, bound to port 2222 (the default is 2181) ensure \`HBASE_MANAGE_ZK\` is commented out or set to \`true\` in *conf/hbase-env.sh* and then edit *conf/hbase-site.xml*    and set \`hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort\` and \`hbase.zookeeper.quorum\`.
You should also set \`hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir\` to other than the default as the default has ZooKeeper persist data under */tmp* which is often cleared on system restart.
In the example below we have ZooKeeper persist to */user/local/zookeeper*.

\`\`\`xml

    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>

    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
    of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
    list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
    this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.

  zookeeper could start dropping sessions if it has to run through a directory of hundreds of thousands of logs which is wont to do around leader reelection time — a process rare but run on occasion whether because a machine is dropped or happens to hiccup.
</Callout>

## Using existing ZooKeeper ensemble

To point HBase at an existing ZooKeeper cluster, one that is not managed by HBase, set \`HBASE_MANAGES_ZK\` in *conf/hbase-env.sh* to false

\`\`\`bash
  ...
  # Tell HBase whether it should manage its own instance of ZooKeeper or not.
  export HBASE_MANAGES_ZK=false
\`\`\`

Next set ensemble locations and client port, if non-standard, in *hbase-site.xml*.

When HBase manages ZooKeeper, it will start/stop the ZooKeeper servers as a part of the regular start/stop scripts.
If you would like to run ZooKeeper yourself, independent of HBase start/stop, you would do the following

\`\`\`bash
\${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase-daemons.sh {start,stop} zookeeper
\`\`\`

Note that you can use HBase in this manner to spin up a ZooKeeper cluster, unrelated to HBase.
Just make sure to set \`HBASE_MANAGES_ZK\` to \`false\`      if you want it to stay up across HBase restarts so that when HBase shuts down, it doesn't take ZooKeeper down with it.

For more information about running a distinct ZooKeeper cluster, see the ZooKeeper [Getting Started Guide](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html).
Additionally, see the [ZooKeeper Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HADOOP2/ZooKeeper+FAQ#ZooKeeperFAQ-7) or the [ZooKeeper documentation](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.10/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkMulitServerSetup) for more information on ZooKeeper sizing.

## SASL Authentication with ZooKeeper

Newer releases of Apache HBase (>= 0.92) will support connecting to a ZooKeeper Quorum that supports SASL authentication (which is available in ZooKeeper versions 3.4.0 or later).

This describes how to set up HBase to mutually authenticate with a ZooKeeper Quorum.
ZooKeeper/HBase mutual authentication ([HBASE-2418](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2418)) is required as part of a complete secure HBase configuration ([HBASE-3025](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-3025)). For simplicity of explication, this section ignores additional configuration required (Secure HDFS and Coprocessor configuration). It's recommended to begin with an HBase-managed ZooKeeper configuration (as opposed to a standalone ZooKeeper quorum) for ease of learning.

### Operating System Prerequisites

You need to have a working Kerberos KDC setup.
For each \`$HOST\` that will run a ZooKeeper server, you should have a principle \`zookeeper/$HOST\`.
For each such host, add a service key (using the \`kadmin\` or \`kadmin.local\`        tool's \`ktadd\` command) for \`zookeeper/$HOST\` and copy this file to \`$HOST\`, and make it readable only to the user that will run zookeeper on \`$HOST\`.
Note the location of this file, which we will use below as *\\$PATH\\_TO\\_ZOOKEEPER\\_KEYTAB*.

Similarly, for each \`$HOST\` that will run an HBase server (master or regionserver), you should have a principle: \`hbase/$HOST\`.
For each host, add a keytab file called *hbase.keytab* containing a service key for \`hbase/$HOST\`, copy this file to \`$HOST\`, and make it readable only to the user that will run an HBase service on \`$HOST\`.
Note the location of this file, which we will use below as *\\$PATH\\_TO\\_HBASE\\_KEYTAB*.

Each user who will be an HBase client should also be given a Kerberos principal.
This principal should usually have a password assigned to it (as opposed to, as with the HBase servers, a keytab file) which only this user knows.
The client's principal's \`maxrenewlife\` should be set so that it can be renewed enough so that the user can complete their HBase client processes.
For example, if a user runs a long-running HBase client process that takes at most 3 days, we might create this user's principal within \`kadmin\` with: \`addprinc -maxrenewlife 3days\`.
The ZooKeeper client and server libraries manage their own ticket refreshment by running threads that wake up periodically to do the refreshment.

On each host that will run an HBase client (e.g. \`hbase shell\`), add the following file to the HBase home directory's *conf* directory:

\`\`\`java
Client {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  useKeyTab=false
  useTicketCache=true;
};
\`\`\`

We'll refer to this JAAS configuration file as *\\$CLIENT\\_CONF* below.

### HBase-managed ZooKeeper Configuration

On each node that will run a zookeeper, a master, or a regionserver, create a [JAAS](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/LoginConfigFile.html)        configuration file in the conf directory of the node's *HBASE\\_HOME*        directory that looks like the following:

\`\`\`java
Server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  useKeyTab=true
  keyTab="$PATH_TO_ZOOKEEPER_KEYTAB"
  storeKey=true
  useTicketCache=false
  principal="zookeeper/$HOST";
};
Client {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  useKeyTab=true
  useTicketCache=false
  keyTab="$PATH_TO_HBASE_KEYTAB"
  principal="hbase/$HOST";
};
\`\`\`

where the *\\$PATH\\_TO\\_HBASE\\_KEYTAB* and *\\$PATH\\_TO\\_ZOOKEEPER\\_KEYTAB* files are what you created above, and \`$HOST\` is the hostname for that node.

The \`Server\` section will be used by the ZooKeeper quorum server, while the \`Client\` section will be used by the HBase master and regionservers.
The path to this file should be substituted for the text *\\$HBASE\\_SERVER\\_CONF* in the *hbase-env.sh* listing below.

The path to this file should be substituted for the text *\\$CLIENT\\_CONF* in the *hbase-env.sh* listing below.

Modify your *hbase-env.sh* to include the following:

\`\`\`bash
export HBASE_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$CLIENT_CONF"
export HBASE_MANAGES_ZK=true
export HBASE_ZOOKEEPER_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$HBASE_SERVER_CONF"
export HBASE_MASTER_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$HBASE_SERVER_CONF"
export HBASE_REGIONSERVER_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$HBASE_SERVER_CONF"
\`\`\`

where *\\$HBASE\\_SERVER\\_CONF* and *\\$CLIENT\\_CONF* are the full paths to the JAAS configuration files created above.

Modify your *hbase-site.xml* on each node that will run zookeeper, master or regionserver to contain:

\`\`\`xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>$ZK_NODES</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.authProvider.1</name>
    <value>org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.SASLAuthenticationProvider</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.kerberos.removeHostFromPrincipal</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.kerberos.removeRealmFromPrincipal</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
\`\`\`

where \`$ZK_NODES\` is the comma-separated list of hostnames of the ZooKeeper Quorum hosts.

Start your hbase cluster by running one or more of the following set of commands on the appropriate hosts:

\`\`\`bash
bin/hbase zookeeper start
bin/hbase master start
bin/hbase regionserver start
\`\`\`

### External ZooKeeper Configuration

Add a JAAS configuration file that looks like:

\`\`\`java
Client {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  useKeyTab=true
  useTicketCache=false
  keyTab="$PATH_TO_HBASE_KEYTAB"
  principal="hbase/$HOST";
};
\`\`\`

where the *\\$PATH\\_TO\\_HBASE\\_KEYTAB* is the keytab created above for HBase services to run on this host, and \`$HOST\` is the hostname for that node.
Put this in the HBase home's configuration directory.
We'll refer to this file's full pathname as *\\$HBASE\\_SERVER\\_CONF* below.

Modify your hbase-env.sh to include the following:

\`\`\`bash
export HBASE_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$CLIENT_CONF"
export HBASE_MANAGES_ZK=false
export HBASE_MASTER_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$HBASE_SERVER_CONF"
export HBASE_REGIONSERVER_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$HBASE_SERVER_CONF"
\`\`\`

Modify your *hbase-site.xml* on each node that will run a master or regionserver to contain:

\`\`\`xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>$ZK_NODES</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.authProvider.1</name>
    <value>org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.SASLAuthenticationProvider</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.kerberos.removeHostFromPrincipal</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.kerberos.removeRealmFromPrincipal</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
\`\`\`

where \`$ZK_NODES\` is the comma-separated list of hostnames of the ZooKeeper Quorum hosts.

Also on each of these hosts, create a JAAS configuration file containing:

\`\`\`java
Server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  useKeyTab=true
  keyTab="$PATH_TO_ZOOKEEPER_KEYTAB"
  storeKey=true
  useTicketCache=false
  principal="zookeeper/$HOST";
};
\`\`\`

where \`$HOST\` is the hostname of each Quorum host.
We will refer to the full pathname of this file as *\\$ZK\\_SERVER\\_CONF* below.

Start your ZooKeepers on each ZooKeeper Quorum host with:

\`\`\`bash
SERVER_JVMFLAGS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$ZK_SERVER_CONF" bin/zkServer start
\`\`\`

Start your HBase cluster by running one or more of the following set of commands on the appropriate nodes:

\`\`\`bash
bin/hbase master start
bin/hbase regionserver start
\`\`\`

### ZooKeeper Server Authentication Log Output

If the configuration above is successful, you should see something similar to the following in your ZooKeeper server logs:

\`\`\`

\`\`\`

### ZooKeeper Client Authentication Log Output

On the ZooKeeper client side (HBase master or regionserver), you should see something similar to the following:

\`\`\`
11/12/05 22:43:59 INFO zookeeper.ZooKeeper: Initiating client connection, connectString=ip-10-166-175-249.us-west-1.compute.internal:2181 sessionTimeout=180000 watcher=master:60000

\`\`\`

### Configuration from Scratch

This has been tested on the current standard Amazon Linux AMI.
First setup KDC and principals as described above.
Next checkout code and run a sanity check.

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase.git
cd hbase
mvn clean test -Dtest=TestZooKeeperACL
\`\`\`

Then configure HBase as described above.
Manually edit target/cached\\_classpath.txt (see below):

\`\`\`bash
bin/hbase zookeeper &
bin/hbase master &
bin/hbase regionserver &
\`\`\`

### Future improvements

#### Fix target/cached\\_classpath.txt

You must override the standard hadoop-core jar file from the \`target/cached_classpath.txt\` file with the version containing the HADOOP-7070 fix.
You can use the following script to do this:

\`\`\`bash
echo \`find ~/.m2 -name "*hadoop-core*7070*SNAPSHOT.jar"\` ':' \`cat target/cached_classpath.txt\` | sed 's/ //g' > target/tmp.txt
mv target/tmp.txt target/cached_classpath.txt
\`\`\`

#### Set JAAS configuration programmatically

This would avoid the need for a separate Hadoop jar that fixes [HADOOP-7070](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7070).

#### Elimination of \`kerberos.removeHostFromPrincipal\` and\`kerberos.removeRealmFromPrincipal\`

## TLS connection to ZooKeeper

Apache ZooKeeper also supports SSL/TLS client connections to encrypt the data in transmission. This is particularly
useful when the ZooKeeper ensemble is running on a host different from HBase and data has to be sent
over the wire.

### Java system properties

The ZooKeeper client supports the following Java system properties to set up TLS connection:

\`\`\`properties
zookeeper.client.secure=true
zookeeper.clientCnxnSocket=org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxnSocketNetty
zookeeper.ssl.keyStore.location="/path/to/your/keystore"
zookeeper.ssl.keyStore.password="keystore_password"
zookeeper.ssl.trustStore.location="/path/to/your/truststore"
zookeeper.ssl.trustStore.password="truststore_password"
\`\`\`

Setting up KeyStore is optional and only required if ZooKeeper server requests for client certificate.

Find more detailed information in the [ZooKeeper SSL User Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/ZooKeeper+SSL+User+Guide).

<Callout type="warn">
  These're standard Java properties which should be set in the HBase command line and are effective in
  the entire Java process. All ZooKeeper clients running in the same process will pick them up including
  co-processors.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Since ZooKeeper version 3.8 the following two properties are useful to store the
  keystore and truststore passwords in protected text files rather than exposing them in the command line.
</Callout>

\`\`\`properties
zookeeper.ssl.keyStore.passwordPath=/path/to/secure/file
zookeeper.ssl.trustStore.passwordPath=/path/to/secure/file
\`\`\`

### HBase configuration

By adding [HBASE-28038](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-28038), ZooKeeper client TLS
settings are also available in *hbase-site.xml* via \`hbase.zookeeper.property\` prefix. In contrast
to Java system properties this could be more convenient under some circumstances.

\`\`\`xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.client.secure</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientCnxnSocket</name>
    <value>org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxnSocketNetty</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.ssl.trustStore.location</name>
    <value>/path/to/your/truststore</value>
  </property>
  ...
</configuration>
\`\`\`

<Callout type="info">
  These settings are eventually transformed into Java system properties, it's just a convenience feature.
  So, the same rules that mentioned in the previous point, applies to them as well.
</Callout>
