See the Hadoop documentation on [HDFS Architecture](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html) for more information.

## NameNode

The NameNode is responsible for maintaining the filesystem metadata. See the above HDFS Architecture link for more information.

## DataNode

The DataNodes are responsible for storing HDFS blocks. See the above HDFS Architecture link for more information.
