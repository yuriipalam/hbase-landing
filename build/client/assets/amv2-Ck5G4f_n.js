Below are notes for devs on key aspects of AMv2 in no particular order.

## Background

Assignment in HBase 1.x has been problematic in operation. It is not hard to see why. Region state is kept at the other end of an RPC in ZooKeeper (Terminal states — i.e. OPEN or CLOSED — are published to the *hbase:meta* table). In HBase-1.x.x, state has multiple writers with Master and RegionServers all able to make state edits concurrently (in *hbase:meta* table and out on ZooKeeper). If clocks are awry or watchers missed, state changes can be skipped or overwritten. Locking of HBase Entities — tables, regions — is not comprehensive so a table operation — disable/enable — could clash with a region-level operation; a split or merge. Region state is distributed and hard to reason about and test. Assignment is slow in operation because each assign involves moving remote znodes through transitions. Cluster size tends to top out at a couple of hundred thousand regions; beyond this, cluster start/stop takes hours and is prone to corruption.

AMv2 (AssignmentManager Version 2) is a refactor ([HBASE-14350](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14350)) of the hbase-1.x AssignmentManager putting it up on a [ProcedureV2 (HBASE-12439)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-12439) basis. ProcedureV2 (Pv2), is an awkwardly named system that allows describing and running multi-step state machines. It is performant and persists all state to a Store which is recoverable post crash. See the companion chapter on [Procedure Framework (Pv2)](/docs/pv2), to learn more about the ProcedureV2 system.

In AMv2, all assignment, crash handling, splits and merges are recast as Procedures(v2).  ZooKeeper is purged from the mix. As before, the final assignment state gets published to *hbase:meta* for non-Master participants to read (all-clients) with intermediate state kept in the local Pv2 WAL-based 'store' but only the active Master, a single-writer, evolves state. The Master's in-memory cluster image is the authority and if disagreement, RegionServers are forced to comply. Pv2 adds shared/exclusive locking of all core HBase Entities — namespace, tables, and regions — to ensure one actor at a time access and to prevent operations contending over resources (move/split, disable/assign, etc.).

This redo of AM atop of a purposed, performant state machine with all operations taking on the common Procedure form with a single state writer only moves our AM to a new level of resilience and scale.

## New System

Each Region Assign or Unassign of a Region is now a Procedure. A Move (Region) Procedure is a compound of Procedures; it is the running of an Unassign Procedure followed by an Assign Procedure. The Move Procedure spawns the Assign and Unassign in series and then waits on their completions.

And so on. ServerCrashProcedure spawns the WAL splitting tasks and then the reassign of all regions that were hosted on the crashed server as subprocedures.

AMv2 Procedures are run by the Master in a ProcedureExecutor instance. All Procedures make use of utility provided by the Pv2 framework.

For example, Procedures persist each state transition to the frameworks' Procedure Store. The default implementation is done as a WAL kept on HDFS. On crash, we reopen the Store and rerun all WALs of Procedure transitions to put the Assignment State Machine back into the attitude it had just before crash. We then continue Procedure execution.

In the new system, the Master is the Authority on all things Assign. Previous we were ambiguous; e.g. the RegionServer was in charge of Split operations. Master keeps an in-memory image of Region states and servers. If disagreement, the Master always prevails; at an extreme it will kill the RegionServer that is in disagreement.

A new RegionStateStore class takes care of publishing the terminal Region state, whether OPEN or CLOSED, out to the *hbase:meta* table.

RegionServers now report their run version on Connection. This version is available inside the AM for use running migrating rolling restarts.

## Procedures Detail

### Assign/Unassign

Assign and Unassign subclass a common RegionTransitionProcedure. There can only be one RegionTransitionProcedure per region running at a time since the RTP instance takes a lock on the region. The RTP base Procedure has three steps; a store the procedure step (REGION\\_TRANSITION\\_QUEUE); a dispatch of the procedure open or close followed by a suspend waiting on the remote regionserver to report successful open or fail (REGION\\_TRANSITION\\_DISPATCH) or notification that the server fielding the request crashed; and finally registration of the successful open/close in hbase:meta (REGION\\_TRANSITION\\_FINISH).

Here is how the assign of a region 56f985a727afe80a184dac75fbf6860c looks in the logs. The assign was provoked by a Server Crash (Process ID 1176 or pid=1176 which when it is the parent of a procedure, it is identified as ppid=1176). The assign is pid=1179, the second region of the two being assigned by this Server Crash.

\`\`\`
2017-05-23 12:04:24,175 INFO  [ProcExecWrkr-30] procedure2.ProcedureExecutor: Initialized subprocedures=[{pid=1178, ppid=1176, state=RUNNABLE:REGION_TRANSITION_QUEUE; AssignProcedure table=IntegrationTestBigLinkedList, region=bfd57f0b72fd3ca77e9d3c5e3ae48d76, target=ve0540.halxg.example.org,16020,1495525111232}, {pid=1179, ppid=1176, state=RUNNABLE:REGION_TRANSITION_QUEUE; AssignProcedure table=IntegrationTestBigLinkedList, region=56f985a727afe80a184dac75fbf6860c, target=ve0540.halxg.example.org,16020,1495525111232}]
\`\`\`

Next we start the assign by queuing ('registering') the Procedure with the framework.

\`\`\`
2017-05-23 12:04:24,241 INFO  [ProcExecWrkr-30] assignment.AssignProcedure: Start pid=1179, ppid=1176, state=RUNNABLE:REGION_TRANSITION_QUEUE; AssignProcedure table=IntegrationTestBigLinkedList, region=56f985a727afe80a184dac75fbf6860c, target=ve0540.halxg.example.org,16020,1495525111232; rit=OFFLINE, location=ve0540.halxg.example.org,16020,1495525111232; forceNewPlan=false, retain=false
\`\`\`

Track the running of Procedures in logs by tracing their process id — here pid=1179.

Next we move to the dispatch phase where we update hbase:meta table setting the region state as OPENING on server ve540. We then dispatch an rpc to ve540 asking it to open the region. Thereafter we suspend the Assign until we get a message back from ve540 on whether it has opened the region successfully (or not).

\`\`\`
2017-05-23 12:04:24,494 INFO  [ProcExecWrkr-38] assignment.RegionStateStore: pid=1179 updating hbase:meta row=IntegrationTestBigLinkedList,H\\xE3@\\x8D\\x964\\x9D\\xDF\\x8F@9\\x0F\\xC8\\xCC\\xC2,1495566261066.56f985a727afe80a184dac75fbf6860c., regionState=OPENING, regionLocation=ve0540.halxg.example.org,16020,1495525111232

\`\`\`

Below we log the incoming report that the region opened successfully on ve540. The Procedure is woken up (you can tell it the procedure is running by the name of the thread, its a ProcedureExecutor thread, ProcExecWrkr-9).  The woken up Procedure updates state in hbase:meta to denote the region as open on ve0540. It then reports finished and exits.

\`\`\`

\`\`\`

Unassign looks similar given it is based on the base RegionTransitionProcedure. It has the same state transitions and does basically the same steps but with different state name (CLOSING, CLOSED).

Most other procedures are subclasses of a Pv2 StateMachine implementation. We have both Table and Region focused StateMachines types.

## UI

Along the top-bar on the Master, you can now find a 'Procedures\\&Locks' tab which takes you to a page that is ugly but useful. It dumps currently running procedures and framework locks. Look at this when you can't figure what stuff is stuck; it will at least identify problematic procedures (take the pid and grep the logs...). Look for ROLLEDBACK or pids that have been RUNNING for a long time.

## Logging

Procedures log their process ids as pid= and their parent ids (ppid=) everywhere. Work has been done so you can grep the pid and see history of a procedure operation.

## Implementation Notes

In this section we note some idiosyncrasies of operation as an attempt at saving you some head-scratching.

### Region Transition RPC and RS Heartbeat can arrive at \\~same time on Master

Reporting Region Transition on a RegionServer is now a RPC distinct from RS heartbeating ('RegionServerServices' Service). An heartbeat and a status update can arrive at the Master at about the same time. The Master will update its internal state for a Region but this same state is checked when heartbeat processing. We may find the unexpected; i.e. a Region just reported as CLOSED so heartbeat is surprised to find region OPEN on the back of the RS report. In the new system, all slaves must cow to the Masters' understanding of cluster state; the Master will kill/close any misaligned entities.

To address the above, we added a lastUpdate for in-memory Master state. Let a region state have some vintage before we act on it (one second currently).

### Master as RegionServer or as RegionServer that just does system tables

AMv2 enforces current master branch default of HMaster carrying system tables only; i.e. the Master in an HBase cluster acts also as a RegionServer only it is the exclusive host for tables such as *hbase:meta*, *hbase:namespace*, etc., the core system tables. This is causing a couple of test failures as AMv1, though it is not supposed to, allows moving hbase:meta off Master while AMv2 does not.

## New Configs
