You can rolling upgrade across HBase versions if they are binary or wire compatible. See the "Rolling Upgrade Between Versions that are Binary/Wire Compatible" section below for more on what this means. Coarsely, a rolling upgrade is a graceful stop each server, update the software, and then restart. You do this for each server in the cluster. Usually you upgrade the Master first and then the RegionServers. See [Rolling Restart](/docs/operational-management/node#rolling-restart) for tools that can help use the rolling upgrade process.

For example, in the below, HBase was symlinked to the actual HBase install. On upgrade, before running a rolling restart over the cluster, we changed the symlink to point at the new HBase software version and then ran

\`\`\`bash
$ HADOOP_HOME=~/hadoop-2.6.0-CRC-SNAPSHOT ~/hbase/bin/rolling-restart.sh --config ~/conf_hbase
\`\`\`

The rolling-restart script will first gracefully stop and restart the master, and then each of the RegionServers in turn. Because the symlink was changed, on restart the server will come up using the new HBase version. Check logs for errors as the rolling upgrade proceeds.

#### Rolling Upgrade Between Versions that are Binary/Wire Compatible \\[!toc]

Unless otherwise specified, HBase minor versions are binary compatible. You can do a rolling upgrades between HBase point versions. For example, you can go to 1.4.4 from 1.4.6 by doing a rolling upgrade across the cluster replacing the 1.4.4 binary with a 1.4.6 binary.

In the minor version-particular sections below, we call out where the versions are wire/protocol compatible and in this case, it is also possible to do a rolling upgrade.
